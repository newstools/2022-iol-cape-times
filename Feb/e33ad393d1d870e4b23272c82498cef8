CAPE TOWN - A fire in Hessequa in the Western Cape rages on after being fuelled by windy and hot weather conditions over the weekend. All firelines remain active in the Gysmanshoek, Hessequa blaze, the Garden Route District Municipality (GRDM) said on Sunday. The fire broke out on February 7. “On the south-eastern fireline – north-west of MTO plantations and Korentepoort  Dam – the wildfire is burning on a backburn. A fire break will be made to safeguard the closest structures to the south,” the GRDM said. “The fireline on the south-west side is also burning on a backburn. Fire breaks were implemented yesterday with success.” On the north-westerly fireline in Brandriver, an active wildfire in close proximity of farmland is currently being attended to. “The objective for today is to extinguish this area,”  the GRDM said. The GRDM's Fire Services, Cape Nature and ground crews, Working on Fire, as well as the local landowner are attending to the scene. On Saturday night, authorities said the firelines on the south-west, north of Heidelberg, as well as south-east, north-west of the Korentepoort Dam and MTO Forestry Plantations, were extremely active after being fuelled by windy and hot weather conditions. “The wind direction changed in our favour and blew from the south. The wildfire then burnt on a backburn, pushing slowly towards farms. This allowed ground crews and a landowner to clear around infrastructure as well as implementing fire breaks on the south-west. “The south-eastern fire line is seen as a threat to the plantations, as well surrounding farms.”  Cape Times
