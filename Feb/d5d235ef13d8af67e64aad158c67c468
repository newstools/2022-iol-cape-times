CAPE TOWN - Bitou Mayor, Davie Swart, says he is satisfied with the qualifications of the senior manager accused of submitting fraudulent information to secure employment at the municipality. Ntho Maredi, who is employed as the municipality’s Manager of Expenditure Management, was appointed to act in the position of municipal manager when the former acting Municipal Manager, Richard Bosman, recently resigned unexpectedly. According to the Ikhwezi Political Movement (IPM), the municipality’s Human Resources Division could not find a copy of a National Diploma in Cost and Management Accounting mentioned in his CV. In a letter dated September 13, 2019, Maredi was requested to provide proof of the qualification. It is alleged that proof of the qualification was never submitted. IPM called for the removal of Maredi, both as acting municipal manager and senior manager. Maredi told the Cape Times the matter was now with his lawyers. “The matter is being handled by my legal counsel. There are questions that my attorney is still awaiting for response from the municipality regarding the matter under discussion. As a result, I wouldn’t want to comment at this stage,” he said. IPM spokesperson Sivuyile Nkomo further alleged that mayor Davie Swart was aware of the allegations. “However, instead of investigating, he decided to promote Mr Maredi to acting municipal manager,” he said. But Swart said the CV that Maredi had submitted to the municipality does not contain any reference to the qualification in question. “I have satisfied myself that the CV presented by Mr Maredi prior to his appointment as acting municipal manager of Bitou Municipality does not contain any reference to the qualification in question. This is the same CV that was considered by Bitou Municipality when he was appointed to his current senior manager position. “All the competencies required for the position of a municipal manager have been completed by Mr Maredi,” said Swart.
