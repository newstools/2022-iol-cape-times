Pretoria - Eskom has kept load shedding suspended on Tuesday due to sufficient recovery in electricity generation capacity. This is after the power utility announced the resumption of Stage 2 load shedding from 9pm on Monday until 5am on Tuesday saying it had  to conserve and replenish emergency reserves.  Fin24 cited Eskom CEO, André de Ruyter saying they were in much better shape than we were a day or two ago. Eskom said since Saturday morning, its teams have returned nine generating units to service which helped with easing the capacity constraints. The power supplier has continued to appeal to South Africans to help avoid the implementation of load shedding by reducing the usage of electricity, saying the power system is severely constrained. Furthermore, Eskom said electricity grid is currently stable. #PowerAlert 08 February 2022 21:00 The electricity grid is currently stable.
