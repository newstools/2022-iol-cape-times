CAPE TOWN - Two Gqeberha house robbery suspects were arrested after returning to the crime scene and being recognised by the victims while police were taking their statements. Police spokesperson Priscilla Naidu said the two suspects, aged 29 and 36, had the audacity to walk past the house soon after they allegedly robbed it while police were attending to the complaint on Friday evening in Buthelezi Street, Ikamvelihle. It is alleged that at about 9.30pm that night, a 33-year-old woman arrived home and as she had just locked her vehicle in the garage, was accosted by two men who pointed a firearm at her. “Her wallet, cellphone, car and house keys were taken from her before shoving her into the house. The complainant’s brother was also threatened,” Naidu said. The suspects ransacked the house and drove off with the woman’s car, a charcoal grey Chevrolet Cruze. “After a while, the suspects returned and took more items from the house. Four cell phones, a laptop, a plasma TV set, bank cards and a wallet were among some of the items taken,” Naidu said. “At about 11.30pm, while SAPS Ikamvelihle members were at the scene busy taking statements and interviewing the victims outside, the two suspects were seen walking past the house. They were immediately recognised by the victims and arrested.” The stolen vehicle was recovered after being found abandoned on Saturday morning in a side street not far from the house. The stolen items have not yet been recovered. The suspects are expected to appear in the New Brighton magistrate’s court on Monday on a charge of house robbery. Cape Times
