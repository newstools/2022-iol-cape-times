CAPE TOWN - A section of Church Street in the Somerset West CBD will be closed to traffic between the intersections of Andries Pretorius Street and Main Road from midnight on Tuesday. The City said the closure will be for at least 24 months – pending any unforeseen delays – due to construction work for a new public transport interchange (PTI) in the CBD. Road users are advised to use alternative routes along Victoria Street or Hunters Lane, and the City appealed to motorists to adhere to the signage on site. The PTI will be constructed on two different sites in the Somerset West CBD: one behind the Town Hall and another on the Shoprite side. The City said it is designed for minibus-taxi operators, bus services, informal traders and thousands of commuters. Mayco member for urban mobility, councillor Rob Quintas said: “We sincerely apologise for the inconvenience. I also want to thank residents and business owners, as well as the local minibus-taxi associations and informal traders in advance for their support during this time. “The construction of the new PTI is the biggest public investment in the central business district of Somerset West in recent years and will transform the CBD area with multiple benefits for commuters, pedestrians, public transport operators and traders.” Cape Times
