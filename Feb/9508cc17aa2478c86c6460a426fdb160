Cape Town – The Cape Winelands District Municipality’s (CWDM) Fire Services says that all fire lines have been contained and there is no active fire or smoke at Theron’s Pass near Ceres. Attempts are still being made to contain a blaze in Gysmanshoek in the Hessequa region. In an update just before midday on Tuesday, the CWDM said the deployment of staff and resources is underway, and all aerial resources have stood down. “The remaining six ground crews are supported by four firefighting vehicles with staff who will continue to monitor and conduct mopping up operations on the 9 km fire line. “Should the conditions stay stable and free of flare-ups, two of the six teams will stand down, and the remaining four will continue with operations throughout the night,” the CWDM said. They noted that the greatest achievement during this massive raging fire, was that the teams were able to prevent the fire from spreading to costly and necessary electrical supply lines and cell phone towers located in the area. “The full extent of fire damage to grazing pastures has not yet been determined, however no damage to orchards, infrastructure, implements or homes has been reported. “The CWDM Fire Services extends their thanks to all contracted services and private individuals for their assistance.” The Garden Route District Municipality (GRDM) meanwhile said fire lines were still under thick mist and visibility was very weak in the Gysmanshoek fire in Hessequa. “GRDM senior management team is on site with fire crews including: eleven GRDM firefighters, 47 Working on Fire members and ten Cape Nature crew members. The chopper is on standby in Riversdale. “The GRDM Deputy Fire Chief reported that all lines are looking good with a couple of hot spots prioritised. There is no danger to any life nor property at this stage.” Cape Times
