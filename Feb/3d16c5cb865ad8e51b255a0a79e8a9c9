CAPE TOWN - Africa Energy Indaba (AEI) 2022, scheduled for March 1-3, in partnership with the City of Cape Town, is set to assemble a host of influential global and local sectoral players. The conference promises to provide participants with the ideal platform for networking, engagement and is anticipated to be an important event for both the African energy sector and the regional economy, promoting tourism, driving job creation, and initiating a much-needed economic recovery. “To further fortify the event’s success, the City of Cape Town has officially partnered with AEI 2022, furnishing pivotal support for the continent’s cardinal event,” organisers said. They said AEI 2022 had accorded priority to Africa’s position in the global energy transition debate, enabling synergetic dialogue pertaining to the continent’s advancement towards renewable energy investment and development. “Accordingly, the City of Cape Town remains at the helm of the nation’s climate strategy, having underscored renewable energy utilisation in its quest to minimise the impacts of climate change. As such, the city’s climate change strategy, which strives to become a city that is climate-resilient, resource-efficient and lower carbon, in order to enable sustainable and inclusive economic and social development, and environmental sustainability, is making significant strides in mitigating emissions and driving renewable elevations,” organisers said. The 14th African Energy Indaba Conference (AEI) combines the hybrid model of virtual discussion and debate from March 1-3 with an on-site Exhibition on March 1 and 2 at the Cape Town International Convention Centre (CTICC) in Cape Town. The three conference days cover many topics, including a critical assessment of the disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic by providing innovative energy options that will facilitate accessible, reliable, and affordable energy to the entire continent and the pertinent themes that symbolise the surge towards African energy freedom.
