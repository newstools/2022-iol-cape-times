CAPE TOWN - All Blue Train operations have been temporarily suspended as a precautionary measure, Transnet announced on Monday. Transnet spokesperson Ayanda Shezi said the decision was made following "recent incidents" referring to the torching of the luxury train’s coach last week. "As a precautionary measure following the recent incidents involving the Blue Train, management has taken the decision to temporarily suspend operations while the train undergoes a thorough technical assessment. The aim is to have the technical assessment concluded as soon as possible, after which the train will be back in service. "The safety of guests and crew on board the train remains a top priority, and will not be compromised. We apologise for the inconvenience caused to guests who had booked upcoming trips on the train. We look forward to offering you our world-class service again soon," said Shezi. On February 8, while in for repairs at the Transnet Engineering facility in Koedoespoort, the train was set alight and a criminal investigation is currently underway. One person was arrested in connection with the fire while two other suspects remain at large. "Three people were seen fleeing the scene. One person was apprehended by Transnet security personnel and handed over to the police. Two other people are still at large,” Shezi had said. The coach in question had been taken to Koedoespoort for repairs after being involved in a derailment last November, and investigations into the derailment were at an advanced stage already, Shezi said, adding that the alleged arson incident had not affected that investigation. The Blue Train had derailed in November at Union Station in Germiston, Gauteng, just after midnight. No passengers were on board.  Cape Times
