CAPE TOWN - A 35-year-old man was sentenced to four years imprisonment after he attempted to bribe a police official with R2000. Hawks spokesperson, Zinzi Hani, said Nkokelo Sarile - who was sentenced on Thursday last week - was arrested during a sting operation and faced a corruption charge. Hani said the man had tried to entice a police officer in exchange for the release of his vehicle which had been seized during the commission of a crime in another matter. "Sarile appeared in the Specialised Commercial Crimes Court in  Bellville for sentencing on a charge of corruption on Thursday, 17 February 2022. He was found guilty and sentenced to 6 years imprisonment of which two years was suspended with conditions. "He will effectively serve a four-year jail term and he was additionally declared unfit to possess a firearm. This follows his failed attempt to entice a police officer with R 2000 gratification in exchange for the release of his vehicle that was seized after it had been used in a commission of crime on another matter. "A sting operation was executed on 3 September 2009 and he was arrested on his arrival at the Hawks offices in Bellville, Cape Town with money intended to induce a police officer to commit a criminal offence, said Hani. He appeared in court shortly after his arrest and was released on R1500 bail. "During the trial process he continually caused further delays with constant changes of his legal representatives. Sarile appeared in court several times until his conviction and sentence (last week)," said Hani.
