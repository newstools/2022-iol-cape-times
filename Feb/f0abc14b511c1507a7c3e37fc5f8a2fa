CAPE TOWN - Thousands of the common platanna, also known as the African clawed frog, have been caught and released in the Onrus River in Hermanus after residents woke up to a croaking surprise on Thursday morning. Platannas are uniquely recognised by their fully webbed hind legs and small front feet. Sheraine van Wyk, of the Whale Coast Conservation, said as the frogs are amphibious and aquatic creatures, they had to stay in water. Van Wyk confirmed this was a “phenomenon” that has only occurred about thrice in the past 30 years.  She said it was not a breeding issue as various sizes of frogs had been migrating and an investigation was under way. “There could be a number of reasons why they have moved between water bodies and we will be investigating this.  “Between 2am and 3am on Thursday morning, we had some rain which was the perfect cover for these resilient creatures to move under as they could be going through a hibernation period.  “Another reason, which could be most likely, is that the food source in the (Vermont Salt Pan) is decreasing, or it could be a more serious issue like the oxygen levels being depleted or a pollution issue,” said Van Wyk. These probabilities all form part of the investigation which Van Wyk said would have started last night. Several residents discovered the frogs during the early hours of Thursday morning, who also helped moved the frogs to the Onrus River. Biodiversity Conservation Manager at the Overstrand Municipality, Tarron Dry, advised residents to keep the Platannas in deep buckets, with high sides filled with water and to phone the Environmental Management Section of Overstrand Municipality on 028 316 3724 / 028 313 5619 (a/h).
