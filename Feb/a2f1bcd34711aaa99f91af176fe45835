CAPE TOWN - While the fuel levy and Road Accident Fund will remain unchanged during  2022-23, this will not be the case for alcohol and cigarettes as prices are set to be hiked. This emerged when Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana on Wednesday tabled his Budget speech in the National Assembly. According to the National Treasury, tax revenue collections for 2021-22 were expected to exceed the 2021 budget estimate by R181.9 billion and the 2021 medium-term budget policy estimate by R61.7bn. It also said tax collections were slightly higher compared to those projected in last year’s Budget. “With the exception of customs duties, other major tax categories have also grown above 2019-20 levels. “Collections of excise duties are recovering from the trade restrictions imposed due to the Covid-19 ban on sales, especially on alcohol, with companies now paying duties deferred during the pandemic. “Similarly, the easing of restrictions has contributed to strong growth in fuel levy collections.” On Wednesday, Godongwana announced that excise duties on alcohol and tobacco would increase by between 4.5 and 6.5%. There are plans to increase the excise duty rate by between 5.5% and 6.5% for consumption of cigars. “Review papers on the alcohol and tobacco excise duties policy framework will be released shortly for comment,” read the budget document. Godongwana said the government was also proposing to introduce a new tax on vaping products of at least R2.90 per millilitre from January 2023. He said a new tax would also be introduced on beer powders. This as the excise duty regime applied a flat rate for traditional African beer powder of 34.7 cents/kg. “There are similar products in the market. In the interest of equity, these products will be included in the tax net with an excise equivalent to the powder rate from I October 2022.” The government is also planning to apply a flat rate excise duty rate of at least R2.90/ml to both nicotine and non-nicotine solutions. “The proposal will be included in the 2022 Taxation laws Amendment Bill for further consultation before being introduced from 1 January 2023.” The minister said after three years of no changes, the health promotion levy would be increased to 2.31 cents per gram of sugar. Godongwana said the tax increases as from Wednesday were: • A 340ml can of beer or cider will cost 11c more; • A 750ml bottle of wine will be 17c more expensive; • A bottle of sparkling wine will cost an additional 76c; • And a bottle of spirits will be R4.83 more expensive; • A packet of cigarettes will cost an additional R1.03; • 25 grams of piped tobacco will cost an extra 37c; and • A 23 gram cigar will be R6.77 more expensive.
