CAPE TOWN - One person has been apprehended in connection with a fire that broke out on a Blue Train in for repairs at the Transnet Engineering facility in Koedoespoort on Tuesday. Transnet spokesperson Ayanda Shezi said they were investigating the cause of the fire which broke out in a coach of the Blue Train early Tuesday morning. “The train was in for repairs at the company’s Engineering facility in Koedoespoort,” Shezi said. “Three people were seen fleeing the scene. One person was apprehended by Transnet security personnel and handed over to the police. Two other people are still at large.” The coach in question had been taken to Koedoespoort for repairs after being involved in a derailment last November, Shezi added. “Transnet has almost completed the investigation into the cause of the November derailment, and as such, today’s incident will not impact the investigations. “Any further information will be provided in due course,” Shezi said. The luxurious Blue Train had derailed in November at Union Station in Germiston, Gauteng, just after midnight. According to reports, 19 empty coaches derailed and no passengers were on board. Transnet said that it would apply remedial action where necessary but there would be no cancellations and it’s freight operations were not impacted. Cape Times
