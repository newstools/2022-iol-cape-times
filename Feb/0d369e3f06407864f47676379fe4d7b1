CAPE TOWN - Tembisa Hospital has shut down temporarily following a fatal shooting incident at the facility on Wednesday morning. According to information, a policeman arrived at the facility in his State vehicle and shortly after parking, shot and killed his partner - an assistant nurse - before turning the gun on himself. The Gauteng Department of Health confirmed the incident that took place earlier Wednesday morning and advised patients to visit other health facilities in the vicinity. "Just after 8am this morning, a 30-year-old police officer entered the hospital driving a  state vehicle with blue lights on and parked at the Accident and Emergency Department's parking lot. The man then called his 30-year-old partner who was on duty at the time to come to the parking lot. Upon arrival the police officer opened fire on the enrolled nursing assistant and turned the gun on himself. "Unfortunately, the nurse died on the scene while the police officer is currently in a critical condition. "Given the tragic incident, the Tembisa Hospital is currently not in a position to receive the public and is diverting calls to nearby facilities. This will allow the police to work on the scene of the incident and for the debriefing and counselling of both staff and patients," a statement read. The department said the incident had left staff members and patients in shock and that Tembisa Hospital would continue to treat patients admitted at the facility while communication regarding the reopening of the hospital will be communicated later in the day.
