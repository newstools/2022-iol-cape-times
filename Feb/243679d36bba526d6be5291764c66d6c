CAPE TOWN - Three foals were among 35 wild horses rescued in Port Nolloth after the Orange River broke its banks due to excessive rain. The National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) said that at 5am on Wednesday, its Port Nolloth duty crew headed to Richtersveld near Alexander Bay to assist Have a Heart Equine Sanctuary and Network for Animals in saving horses trapped on islands along the flooded Orange River. The horses were scattered in groups across a number of smaller islands that they sought refuge on. Members of the public also assisted, including four Namibians, Jacques Kemp, Mark Kemp, Mauricio Smit and Dewald van Jaarsveld, as they launched their two private boats to assist in the operation. “As islands were flooded the horses were forced to swim to the next island, causing the horses to be scattered over a large area, some already standing on islands that had submerged,” the NSRI said. “In an intense operation the horses were corralled and walked through chest-deep water and at places swam through water to reach larger islands. “We went from island to island continuing to assist until all of the horses were safe. “In total 35 horses, which included three foals, were assisted to safety. “Once all horses were out of danger no further assistance was required and the operation was completed at approximately 11am. “The four Namibians, Have a Heart, Network for Animals and our NSRI Port Nolloth rescue team are commended for saving the horses,” the NSRI said.
