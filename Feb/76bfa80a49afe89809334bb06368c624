CAPE TOWN - The Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) is probing culpable homicide after a homeless man was killed when a police van lost control and ploughed into him while chasing suspected criminals in Bellville at the weekend. The 30-year-old man was knocked over by the State vehicle at about 2pm on Sunday while standing near the corner of Bill Bezuidenhout and Old Paarl roads. According to Ipid spokesperson Grace Langa, they received reports that police officers stationed in Bellville were chasing a silver Toyota Corolla with no registration number along Voortrekker Road that day. “While still chasing the said vehicle, it happened that on the corner of Bill Bezuidenhout and Old Paarl road, the SAPS vehicle bumped a traffic light together with an innocent bystander that was standing next to the traffic light. “The injured person was declared dead at the scene while the silver Toyota managed to flee,” Langa said. “Necessary investigative aids were summoned to the scene. A culpable homicide case was registered and investigations are ongoing.” She said the police officers – the driver a constable and the passenger a sergeant – were not injured during the incident. Ipid also stated that a lead is being followed up to try to track down the homeless man’s family and inform them about the incident.
