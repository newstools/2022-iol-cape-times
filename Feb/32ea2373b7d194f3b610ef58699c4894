CAPE TOWN - The Two Oceans Aquarium has welcomed four new additions after an eagle ray recently gave birth to pups at the marine life centre. The pups which need no parental care will be spending some time at the centre before  being released into the wild. Two Oceans Aquarium spokesperson Renée Leeuwner, said: "Stingrays, like the Aquarium’s eagle rays, are 'ovoviviparous', which means that the mother keeps the eggs inside her body after they have hatched, feeding the pups fluids and egg yolks to help them grow. "Because of the lifestyle these rays live, pups need to be competent swimmers almost immediately when they are born - there is no time for a baby to learn or grow before needing to survive in the wild. So, after a few short minutes of disorientation, while they figure out which way is up, and how their muscles work, the baby rays can swim, move and survive just like their adult mother. No parental care needed." The mother eagle ray is currently in the I&J Ocean Exhibit at the Aquarium while the four little pups are being kept in the ray pool in the Diversity Gallery. The baby rays will be spending some time acting as animal ambassadors for this critically endangered species, before being released into the wild, Leeuwner said.
