THE City of Cape Town’s Corporate Services Directorate has warned residents and jobseekers not to fall victim to a fake advertisement for learner law enforcement officers. The City advertised a vacancy in 2017 and the closing date for applications was September 8, 2017. The advert then became invalid, but it is still being circulated and desperate and unsuspecting people are applying for a non-existent employment opportunity. The City said it has received about 2 600 applications in response to this fake advert. The advertisement has been sent to prospective applicants via WhatsApp. It has also been seen on Facebook pages and on job seeker platforms around Cape Town. “This is cruel and creates an expectation and false hope for an opportunity for employment. Unemployment in South Africa is at an all-time high and sadly, the youth who are already having difficulty securing jobs, is the target audience,” Mayco member for corporate services Theresa Uys said. “It is no wonder we received approximately 2 600 applications in response to this fake advert. I want to reiterate that this advert is fake and creates absolute devastation for individuals who saw this as an opportunity to be considered for this role. I again appeal to applicants to check the details of the advert, the reference number will always indicate the current year and the closing date will be within the same time period. I also want to warn those who are circulating this advert that they are committing a crime and can be held responsible for their actions. “City staff are also reminded to check the validity of job adverts before forwarding them on,” said Uys. The City appealed to residents to report fraudulent activities to police.
