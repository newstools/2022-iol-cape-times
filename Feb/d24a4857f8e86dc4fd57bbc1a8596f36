CAPE TOWN - The long-awaited MyCiTi N2 Express bus service is set to resume operation on February 19. Mayco member for urban mobility Rob Quintas on Sunday announced the first buses will depart from Kapteinsklip in Mitchells Plain and Kuyasa in Khayelitsha shortly after 5am and will travel along the N2 freeway to the Civic Centre station in the Cape Town CBD. “Last year, I made a commitment to Capetonians that the City will do all we can to get the N2 Express service back on the road in the first quarter of the new year. We are now ready to deliver on this promise.” Before the service was suspended in May 2019, up to 6 000 passengers used it on a daily basis. “I want to thank our partners from the N2 Company who will be operating the service: Lisekhonikamva (Codeta) from Khayelitsha, Mitchells Plain Rapid Transit (Route Six from Mitchells Plain), and Golden Arrow Bus Services (Gabs) and City officials,” Quintas said. The bus fleet is being serviced, bus drivers are being trained and familiarised with the routes, and the vandalised bus shelters will be repaired or replaced in coming weeks. “We will, over a period of four weeks, gradually add more buses to the routes as more commuters return to the service. Our intention is to have the whole fleet of 34 buses operational by  March 19 2022, if all goes as planned,” Quintas said. The service will resume in three phases, starting off with three of the four routes. •            Phase 1:  February 19 to March 4 2022 (D01, D02, D04), which will be a limited start-up service •            Phase 2: March 5 to 18 (D01, D02, D04), additional buses will be added to match the increase in passenger demand •            Phase 3: March 19 onwards (D01, D02, D03, D04), the D03 route is introduced as the service becomes fully operational Commuters can find the time schedules and latest information about the routes by visiting: https://www.myciti.org.za/en/routes-stops/n2-express.
