CAPE TOWN - The family of Ashley Oosthuizen, who is facing life imprisonment in Thailand for alleged international drug trafficking, has warned the public against donating to crowdfunding sites created claiming to assist with her release. Oosthuizen, 22, had moved to Thailand in March 2018 to do a Teaching English as a Foreign Language (TEFL) course so she can teach kindergartens on the island of Koh Samui after matriculating in 2017. It is there that she is said to have met 35- year-old American teacher, Tris Nepps, who soon became her boyfriend. When Oosthuizen was laid off during the pandemic, Nepps who is alleged to be smuggling drugs on the island, had apparently offered her employment at his restaurant. Oosthuizen was reportedly arrested on October 8, 2020 by Thailand police after accepting a package addressed to a person called Dave van Rensburg containing MDMA while working at the restaurant. She had apparently signed the package, not knowing it contained the narcotic MDMA, and she was immediately detained and handed a death sentence which was later reduced to life imprisonment on August 18, 2021, for international drug trafficking.  Her father, Andre Oosthuizen who said his daughter had no criminal record and that the family was shocked when they learnt of the arrest. The family’s legal representatives have since applied to appeal the sentence. Mother Lynn Blignaut, said the public is asked to donate, if they wish to do so, only to Ashley’s Trust fund which she will soon set up, and not to donate to any other crowdfunding platform under any circumstances.  Blignaut said the family will fight to prove Ashley’s innocence. “I spoke to her on Friday for 15 minutes. She says she did struggle with stomach problems during January but by God’s grace she is healthy once again. She is in high spirits and in good health. We are trusting the Lord to make a way where there seems to be no way,” Blignaut said. Cape Times
