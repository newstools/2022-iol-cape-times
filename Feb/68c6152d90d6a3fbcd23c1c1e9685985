CAPE TOWN - The pornography distribution case against a Bonteheuwel mother, accused of publishing pictures of her 4-year-old child on the dark web, has yet again been postponed. The matter has been transferred to the Parow Regional Court, with the mom appearing briefly on Tuesday morning. The court heard the State would formulate its final charge sheet. Bonteheuwel ward councillor Angus Mckenzie said: "The accused has been held for more than six months with no formal charges laid. This is an absolute travesty of justice. Indeed, now we can factually say, justice delayed is justice denied. "These delays and the inability of the investigating officers to formulate charges send out completely the incorrect message to those considering or attempting to harm our women and children.  “For the sake of the victim, a young child and for all victims of GBV, I am desperately imploring the justice system to act. As a country we will never stop the scourge of GBV as long as the very laws meant to protect us from it, the custodians thereof are failing to implement," said Mckenzie. The mother, 32, was arrested last year after she was accused of selling pictures of her daughter online. The FBI picked up her alleged activity on the internet and a US Homeland Security official posed as a potential online buyer and traced her via geo-tagging, resulting in her arrest. The matter was postponed to March 1.   Cape Times
