CAPE TOWN - The Animal Welfare Society (AWS) of South Africa has issued a warning to pet owners to never put their pet in a boot, as they can suffocate to death. An adult female Husky cross and her seven puppies were rescued after being found confined in the sweltering hot boot of their owner’s car on Monday. AWS spokesperson Allan Perrins said they took possession of the Husky Cross and her six-week-old puppies. “How they survived the suffocating almost hour-long trip from Rocklands in Mitchells Plain to our headquarters in Philippi is nothing short of miraculous. “When we opened the boot we noticed that the puppies were quite tightly squashed together without any ventilation – another 15 minutes in the boot and they would almost certainly have suffocated to death. “Thankfully, we managed to get all of the dogs out in good time and the owner agreed to surrender them to us.”  Despite their ordeal, the dogs are doing well and are ready to be adopted. The Animal Welfare Society of South Africa offers the following advice to pet owners who enjoy the company of a Canine Cruising Companion: Dog owners have also been encouraged to invest in a canine seat belt or dog harness to keep their dogs safely restrained while in the car.
