CAPE TOWN - Police divers continue the search for a Mandalay teenager who was swept away in rip currents at Sunset Beach in Melkbosstrand at the weekend. Melkbosstrand's National Sea Rescue Institute spokesperson, Terence Lawson, said the teenager who had gone missing in the surf, was one of four teenagers, who got into difficulty. However, three of the teenagers were rescued by bystanders – including a Mauritian couple. "On arrival at the scene it was determined that four males, aged in their late teens, were in difficulty in the surf. One was rescued by two bystanders, a husband and wife, from Mauritius, using an NSRI pink rescue buoy.  “Then an additional bystander had launched into the water with a body board to go to the aid of two of the teenagers, while the Mauritian man also returned to the water, with the pink rescue buoy, and two of the teenagers were rescued and brought to the  shore. "A teenager, 18, from Mandalay, Cape Town, was missing in the surf. Despite an extensive search there remains no sign of the missing teenager. Police divers attended at the scene and are continuing in an ongoing search," said Lawson. According to Lawson, moments before the teenagers were taken by the rip current, another woman was rescued by two men who had also used the help of the pink buoy. "She was rescued to the shore and before her cousin could warn the four male teenagers of the strong rip current they were swept away," said Lawson. NSRI Melkbosstrand, NSRI Table Bay, Milnerton Surf lifesaving, WC Government Health EMS rescue squad and ambulance, Life Healthcare response paramedics, City of Cape Town (CoCT) Law Enforcement officers, the community and SAPS responded to the teenager incident.
