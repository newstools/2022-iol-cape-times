CAPE TOWN - In a fatal accident at the Voëlklip cliff in Herolds Bay, a 33-year-old man was killed when his bakkie plunged off the lookout point on Tuesday morning. Emergency Medical Services (EMS) spokesperson Deanna February said a call for assistance came through at about 8:40am. “One male patient, aged 33, was in the vehicle when it left the cliff. Unfortunately, he sustained fatal injuries and his body was recovered by the WCGH’s Air Mercy Services (AMS) and EMS Rescue officials. “Four rescue vehicles attended the scene as well as Forensic Pathology Services officials. They followed the standard protocol whilst the body of the deceased was recovered,”  February said. At around 1pm, the scene was cleared. “We would like to extend our sincere condolences to the family and friends of the dead man,” February said. To prevent a further tragedies at the site, more than 50 permanent, 1.8m poles were erected along the curve at Voëlklip Road in March last year. Large rocks were also installed at the informal parking area where deaths had been reported. The move came after the bodies of two elderly women were retrieved after their car went down the cliff last year. In January, a 34-year-old mother and her two-year-old daughter were also killed when their car went over the cliff. The toddler's body was found at sea two weeks later. To address the number of deaths at the site, which runs through privately-owned land, the George Municipality facilitated a task team consisting of members of the Department of Environmental Affairs, the provincial Transport and Public Works department, the Herolds Bay Ratepayers’ Association, and the property owner.
