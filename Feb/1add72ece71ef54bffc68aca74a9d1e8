Cape Town - A 24-year-old suspect has been hospitalised after a shootout with police in Elsies River on Monday. The SAPS said members of the Maitland Flying Squad were in Halt Road, Elsies River on another matter, when a man approached them, saying someone was shooting at him. The members then noticed the suspect in a side road and gave chase. “The suspect pointed the police members with a firearm, in which the members fired at the suspect, wounding him in the right arm. “A 24-year-old suspect was arrested and a 9mm pistol with no serial number and ammunition was recovered,” SAPS Western Cape spokesperson Joseph Swartbooi said. In an unrelated incident, Atlantis police members attended to a complaint in Robinvale on Saturday, when a man said that he was hit over his head with a firearm. He directed the police to the suspect. “When the police members entered Hobby Avenue, they noticed a group of young people sitting around a fire. “As the patrol vehicle stopped, one of the boys tried to flee, dropping an object in full view of the police members, but was apprehended. “Upon searching the area, they confiscated a firearm under a tree, covered with blood. “The 14-year-old boy was arrested and detained on a charge of possession of an unlicensed firearm. “Once charged, the suspects are expected to make their respective court appearances in the Goodwood and Atlantis Magistrate’s courts,” Swartbooi said.
