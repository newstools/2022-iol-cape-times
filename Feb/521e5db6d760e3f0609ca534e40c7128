CAPE TOWN - More than 100 motorists and motorcyclists drove in convoy through some of the busiest roads in Cape Town in support of the Canadian Truckers Convoy who are taking a stand against Covid-19 regulations and vaccination mandates. The Cape Town Freedom convoy event on Saturday formed part of an international effort called World Wide Demonstration. The convoy started at the Koeberg Interchange and travelled in a circular route via the M5, N2, R300 and the N1, ending back at the Koeberg Interchange. By 1pm, the crowd had already dispersed Founder of activist groups including Stop farm killings, Debbie Els said the convoy was a success. “I have never been to such a big convoy before. I’m fighting for the children, they need to wear masks at school in this heat and they are collapsing." “We have to fight for our future and our children’s future because they are the people who are going to suffer. We cannot allow the government to dictate us and be forced to do things we don't want to do, perhaps for religious sake,” she said. Els added that she is not an anti-vaxxer and does believe in vaccines however she does not believe in being told how many times one should get the jab as well as a booster shot. A participant who asked to remain anonymous said the World Wide Demonstration movement were not anti-vaxxers but freedom fighters. “Our message was freedom and generally becoming aware of what is going on and to show others that there are people who are standing together, who want a democracy and who want their freedom not forced vaccines,” they said, adding that the event on Saturday went well with the assistance of police. Cape Town Traffic spokesperson Kevin Jacobs said: “No incidents were reported and the crowd dispersed peacefully.“ Cape Times
