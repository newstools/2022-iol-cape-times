CAPE TOWN - Tuesday (today) marks one year since 78-year-old Lorraine Jantjies from Genadendal, who has Alzheimer’s, went missing without a trace. Her husband, Freddie Jantjies, 79, had just gone to fetch his prostate cancer medication from the clinic on February 15. When he returned, his wife of 46 years, was gone.  A broken-hearted Freddie died mere months later without any answers. There have since been no new leads on her case, police confirmed on Tuesday. “Kindly be advised that the person mentioned in your enquiry is still missing,” police spokesperson Wesley Twigg said. “All available leads were pursued and the investigating officer requested that any new information with regards to the missing person be shared with him on 079 893 9907/028 251 1014,” said Twigg. Lorraine’s family has yet to find closure, said Albert Adams, 64, a former policeman and family member. “I made a promise to my uncle on his death bed that I would find her, cremate her body and send her ashes back home. It has been very hard because the two of them were like my own parents.” Adams said it had been difficult dealing with police as he felt they were not giving the case their best efforts. “The police say they do this and that, but they never come back to us if I follow up.” Brigadier Donovan Heilbron, the commander of the Overberg District, had previously said that they had questioned the son but he was not charged or arrested. According to Adams, an organisation that helps track and trace missing people had been promising the family for months it  would come and do a search, to no avail. “The lady keeps making empty promises. Every time she says they are one their way, I go to our meeting point then she comes up with excuses.  “Meanwhile our family have sent money to contribute to their food and expenses but they still haven't come since last August.” Cape Times
