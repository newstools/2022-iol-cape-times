CAPE TOWN - Gugulethu - born writer, poet and performer Primrose Mrwebi has been described as a shining light in the arts sector with a passion for community development. The mother of one, who had been battling cancer for years, died on Saturday afternoon. Mrwebi had for the last few years played an important part in the Baxter Theatre’s Zabalaza Theatre Festival as a facilitator and adviser. A graduate of the Waterfront Theatre School, she was a frequent contributor at literary festivals across the province, including the Book Week for Young Readers, and was dedicated to supporting younger writers. She also founded the PrimPoetry Foundation, which gave younger writers and artists a platform to perform their work. Mrwebi wrote and edited for titles including Cosmopolitan, Fairlady and Bona. Mrwebi’s sister Belinda said her sibling’s biggest passion was to see black children from the township able to read and write. “I will remember her with her beautiful smile and her ability to make the most difficult situation so simple, and her love for jazz music and poetry. Her legacy is the PrimPoetry Foundation whose primary vision is to promote and develop the culture of reading and writing.” “She is leaving behind her son, mother, father, and two sisters,” said Belinda. Cultural Affairs and Sport MEC Anroux Marais said: “Primrose was truly a shining light in the arts sector. She actively worked to give back to young artists and her support to the Zabalaza festival was invaluable. “We have lost a great woman in the arts and culture sector with her passing. Our condolences go out to Primrose’s family, friends and colleagues. “We will continue celebrating her life for many years to come and her legacy will live on in the art of the young people who she inspired.” Cape Times
