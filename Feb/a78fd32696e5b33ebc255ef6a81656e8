CAPE TOWN - A tip-off over a stolen drain cover led to the arrest of a wanted murderer in Manenberg at the weekend. The City said that two law enforcement officers from the Water and Sanitation Department were conducting their daily duties on Saturday morning, which includes site visits and escort duties. During this time they received a tip off from the community about a man who allegedly damaged a water main. “The public members informed the officers that the suspect was standing on the corner of Rio Grand and Renoster Street. They detained the suspect and transported him to Manenberg SAPS, where it was found he was on the database and was wanted for multiple murders. “He was then charged and booked in at Manenberg SAPS,” the City said. Water and Sanitation Mayco member, Zahid Badroodien, applauded the public for sharing information. “Thank you to the community for taking the initiative to report this to our officers. This is a good example of how co-operation with law enforcement can help communities. We also appreciate the prompt response from our team to follow up on the tip-off.” Enforcement officers have had to be assigned specifically to water and sanitation functions due to increasing vandalism and threats/violence against staff responding to service requests in some communities.
