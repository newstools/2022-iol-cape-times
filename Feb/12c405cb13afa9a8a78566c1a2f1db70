CAPE TOWN - Scientific journals and publishers accepting funding from manufacturers and distributors of breast-milk substitutes or formulas creates a conflict of interest and discourages mothers from breastfeeding, and this practice should stop, says a new research study. This recommendation is contained in a research title, “Conflicts of interest are harming maternal and child health: time for scientific journals to end relationships with manufacturers of breast-milk substitutes”, published on Tuesday. Co-authors Professor Rina Swart, Extra-Ordinary Professor Tanya Doherty, current PhD candidate in Public Health and former university lecturer Catherine Pereira-Kotze, all affiliated with the University of the Western Cape (UWC), found that 40 years after the World Health Assembly first adopted the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes, “inappropriate” marketing of breast-milk substitutes persists, and puts infants and young children at risk of “malnutrition, illness and death”. “The promotion and support of breastfeeding globally is thwarted by the US$57billion (and growing) formula industry that engages in overt and covert advertising and promotion, as well as extensive political activity to foster policy environments conducive to market growth,” the study found. “This includes health professional financing and engagement through courses, e-learning platforms, sponsorship of conferences and health professional associations and advertising in medical/health journals.” According to the authors, this, in turn, contributes to the overuse of formula,  inappropriate dissemination of health and nutrition claims, and largely reduces breastfeeding initiation, exclusivity and duration, irrespective of country context. Article 7.2 of the Code states that “Information provided by manufacturers and distributors to health professionals regarding products within the scope of this Code should be restricted to scientific and factual matters, and such information should not imply or create a belief that bottle-feeding is equivalent or superior to breastfeeding.’’ They said some ‘advertisement features’ cleverly combine editorial style presentation with advertising content, and serve to normalise formula milk for health professionals who are opinion leaders in communities and health systems. With the fine-print stating that the advertiser is responsible for the content  obscured by “large print headlines, sentimental pictures and imperious proclamations about scientific findings“, and “by receiving funding from breast-milk substitute manufacturers, journals create a conflict of interest, whereby the publisher and readers of the journal may favour corporations consciously or unconsciously in ways that undermine scientific integrity, editorial independence and clinical judgement,“  said the authors.
