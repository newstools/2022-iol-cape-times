CAPE TOWN - Nine Oudtshoorn traffic department employees as well as the owner and employees of a driving school in the region were arrested for allegedly selling driving licences. The arrests on Friday came following a court-driven initiative between the SAPS Western Cape Detectives’ Commercial Crime Investigation Unit , Crime Intelligence and the Western Cape Department of Transport. SAPS South Cape spokesperson Malcolm Pojie said the suspects were expected to appear in court on Monday. “These arrests stem from covert operations done over a period of time based on allegations that the arrestees all form part of an organised syndicate whereby learner and or driver’s licences were issued to applicants in return for gratification, using the local driving school. “Armed with search and seizure warrants, the integrated team pounced on the Oudtshoorn driver licence offices as well as the houses of identified suspects to execute the arrests. “Subsequent to the arrests they also seized a Mercedes 14-ton truck, a sedan motor vehicle, cellphones, computer equipment and an undisclosed amount of cash, all allegedly directly linked to the illicit transactions. “The suspects, who are all in police custody, are scheduled to make their first court appearance in the Oudtshoorn Magistrate’s Court on Monday, February 21 2022. “Due to the extent of the offences allegedly committed, bail will certainly be opposed. “The accused face charges related to, but not limited to, contraventions of the Road Traffic Act, fraud, corruption and contravention of POCA ( Prevention of Organised Crime Act), which amounts to money laundering. “Western Cape provincial management has lauded all the members involved for their diligence and commitment to bring these suspects to book. Their allegedly illicit acts and greed contribute to the endangerment of all road users and pedestrians alike,” Pojie said.  Cape Times
