CAPE TOWN - Delays in DNA profiling has left Klawer mother Gertrude Diergal in anxious limbo, as human remains found along the N7 between Klawer and Vanrhynsdorp could be that of her daughter. It’s been more than three years since then eight-year-old Jeneva Diergal, who lived with disabilities, mysteriously disappeared. A captain at the Vredendal Police Station has been assigned to investigate and assess Jeneva’s missing person case. The officer is said to have contacted Patriotic Alliance deputy provincial leader, Sammy Claasen, with information that the police found bones, or a human skeleton, at the end of August last year. The captain apparently said they were unable to do DNA tests, and were currently busy constructing the facial identity of the skeleton. Gertrude said all she could do was to wait to hear any new feedback. “I feel hurt, although it has been three years the pain does not go away, I just learn to live with it everyday. “I can’t think of who would take my daughter away from me, I have no enemies and everyone knows everyone where we live.” Gertrude said that when they found the human remains, she had gone for a blood test but that was the end of it. She never heard anything again. “I just want to find my daughter and bury her, even if they find just the legs, it's fine. I want to know that my daughter is resting peacefully and that I am aware of where she is. I would like to put this behind me and move forward.” A meeting between the police and Klawer residents is expected soon to discuss Jeneva’s disappearance, as well as that of Janine Bottom who went missing more than 18 months ago. The SAPS did not respond to several requests for comment by  deadline on Thursday. Cape Times
