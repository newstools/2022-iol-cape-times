CAPE TOWN - Judgment in the review application case of anti-abortion doctor Jacques de Vos has been set reserved in the North Gauteng High Court.  The matter was heard on Tuesday, as De Vos argued that his right to be heard had been infringed when the pregnant woman he was accused of having treated in an unprofessional manner, said she no longer wanted to proceed with the matter. During 2017, the woman lodged a complaint with the Health Professions Council of SA (HPCSA) against De Vos, who was an intern at 2 Military Hospital, for allegedly dissuading her from terminating her pregnancy. It was alleged that he likened her terminating her pregnancy to the “killing of a human being”. De Vos was charged with allegedly dissuading the patient from terminating her pregnancy, disrespecting the dignity of the patient, and using emotive language to convey his beliefs. De Vos has since been barred from practising as a doctor. In a statement, Doctors for Life, said: "The HPCSA refused to reconvene the hearing so that the committee could hear the case and deliver a verdict, and cited as reason that the ‘complainant does not want to proceed’.  “Since July 2017, Dr de Vos has been unable to proceed with this career as the HPCSA would not issue him with a Medical Practitioner number, as the hearing had not been concluded.” Doctors For Life has been assisting De Vos since the beginning of 2017 with legal representation as well as renowned expert witnesses in the fields of embryology, human anatomy, and psychology.
