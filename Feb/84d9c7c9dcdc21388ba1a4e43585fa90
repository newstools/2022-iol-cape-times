CAPE TOWN - South Africa’s national Lifesaving team clinched first place at the 2022 Lifesaving Africa Championships held in Alexandria, Egypt earlier this month. The Egyptian Diving and Lifesaving Federation (EDLF) welcomed its African counterparts under the slogan: ‘Africa United to Stop Drowning’. With a relatively inexperienced squad, South Africa dominated the water events and was the main catalyst in the Proteas finishing the championships with a combined total of 500 points. Hosts Egypt finished second with 468 points and Morocco came in third with 410 points. Competing for South Africa, Chevan Clarke said: “My experience in Egypt was phenomenal, it was exceptional to see a team come together. In terms of team effort, everybody played their role in doing what needed to happen to get the points to secure a win.” “Overall I enjoyed it, especially getting some international exposure since Covid-19,” he said. Clarke participated in the Men’s Sprints, Men’s flags where he came second place and Beach Sprint Mixed Relay where he won first place. He has been part of the Durban Surf Lifesaving club since 2019 but got involved in lifesaving in 2014. “I got involved with it through some friends of mine who were swimming before and they asked me to come and join them and I just fell in love with the sport which is lifesaving.” “I was training very hard prior to the festive period but due to the postponement it was difficult to plan a way forward as there were a whole lot of other things that were juggling in terms of training,” he said. President of the ILS-Africa Confederation Dr Mohamed Ali Gharbal said he was encouraged to see the event taking place. “We’re confident that this African Championship will not only shine a light on lifesaving sport in Egypt, but also accentuate the youthful energy and high performance that all lifesaving sport disciplines can bring to Africa and the world stage,” said Gharbal.
