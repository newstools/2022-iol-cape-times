CAPE TOWN - The Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA) says its inspections in Delft have led to the arrests of two unregistered doctors in locum while the medical practitioners they were working for will be reported for misconduct to the Medical and Dental Professions Board. The inspection by HPCSA’s Inspectorate Office on Monday was to ensure that practitioners in the area were complying with the set regulations as outlined in the Health Professions Act. “During the inspection the team found that Dr Akana, a registered practitioner had employed an unregistered locum, Mr Keland Didier, a Congolese national who indicated that he had been employed by Dr Akana since December 2021,” HPCSA Corporate Affairs head Christopher Tsatsawane said. He said at another inspection also in Delft, the team found Pitshou Binsansa Kama, also known as Lumbidi Tshumbu Rodriquez, practising as a medical practitioner while not registered with the health council. “Mr Rodriquez informed the inspections team that he had been Dr Benjamin Kalala’s (a registered practitioner) locum since 31 January 2022. Both Mr Keland Didier and Mr Lumbidi Tshumbu Rodriquez were arrested and detained at Delft SAPS for contravention of Sec 17 (1), 33, 34 and 39 of the Health Professions Act and they appeared in court on Tuesday,” Tsatsawane said. He said the health council was continuously upholding its mandate of protecting the public and guiding the profession. “Hence, it is working tirelessly to ensure that fraudulent persons masquerading as healthcare practitioners are apprehended and brought to book. Safeguarding the health profession is a collective responsibility that will ensure the public’s safety and that medical care is provided by registered persons.  “The HPCSA is mandated to protect the public and guide the professions through enforcement and compliance from the healthcare practitioners in line with the provisions of the Health Professions Act,” Tsatsawane said.
