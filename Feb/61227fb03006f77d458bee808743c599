CAPE TOWN - Camps Bay Beach, Glen Beach and the Camps Bay Tidal Pool remain closed to the public until results from water tests allow for the safe usage of the sea, following a failure at the Camps Bay Marine Outfall pump station. Mayco member for water and sanitation Zahid Badroodien said on Sunday the water and sanitation team worked tirelessly into the early hours of the morning in order to successfully replace one of the damaged pumps. “It has since been installed, tested and it is currently functioning. Work is under way to install a spare pump. No sewage is being pumped via pipes into the surf as the repair work has been completed. Measures will be implemented to prevent incidents of this nature from occurring again,” Badroodien said. The beaches remain closed until results from water-testing  allow for the safe usage of the sea. “City health officials will be on site to assess the environment and to ensure that all signs remain in place until further notice. “I appeal to all beach users to be cautious and to exercise responsible behaviour. “Thank you to all the officials that were on site yesterday. The rapid response to contain and manage the pump failure, potentially as a result of load-shedding damage to the pumps, is appreciated.” The pump station at the Camps Bay Marine Outfall experienced failure at about 8pm on Friday resulting in the flooding of the pump station, rendering it out of service Badroodien said on Saturday it was suspected that the cause of the failure of the two main pumps at the Camps Bay Marine Outfall could be related to an electrical fault resulting from frequent power outages. Teams attempted to use vacuum trucks but due to the huge volume, the sewage would have to be discharged from the pump station out to sea as a temporary measure, Badroodien had said. Pumping directly into the sea would eliminate the sewage flow across the beach and enable the teams to restore the operation of the pump station as soon as possible. Cape Times
