Cape Town - In a 27-hour rescue mission, Western Cape Wilderness Search and Rescue (WSAR) teams assisted a group of nine hikers, one of them injured, to safety at the weekend. WSAR said its teams were activated late on Saturday evening after the hikers called for assistance while hiking on the Simonsberg. “The group, aged between 16 and 78, hiked up the Simonsberg outside of Stellenbosch on Saturday. Due to the inclement weather, they were unable to find their intended route down from the summit and called for help when it started to get dark,” WSAR said. A rescue team followed the party's route and finally located them close to the summit just after 2.20am. “The team found a cave and decided to wait for first light before guiding the group any further. “A second team hiked up to the group in the early hours of the morning with additional warm clothing and a stove,” WSAR said. By 8.30am on Sunday it was light enough to start walking and the entire group began making their way down in very poor conditions. “At 10am, one of the patients slipped and fell approximately 10m, sustaining injuries that required a stretcher carry. “The remaining hikers, cold and tired, were slowly guided down the mountain, while additional resources were activated,” it said. The stretcher and additional rescue equipment was carried up to the patient and a technical lower of about 150m commenced, bringing the patient to a point where she could be carried down the last 400m of altitude to the cars. “The fallen hiker was finally handed over to a waiting ambulance at 9.30pm, before being transported to hospital. “We’d like to thank all of the members who worked tirelessly through the night and in such poor conditions,” WSAR said. During the coldest months of the year, WSAR reminded all mountain users to pack extra warm clothing, keep an eye on the weather forecasts, and plan their adventures accordingly.
