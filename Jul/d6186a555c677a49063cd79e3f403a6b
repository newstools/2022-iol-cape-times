Cape Town - Police are investigating culpable homicide after two learners were killed and another injured and in hospital, after a police vehicle ploughed into them on Monday. The learners were coming from Mfuleni Technical Academy High School when they were knocked down on Old Faure Road between Mew Way and Spine Road, near Sanitiser informal settlement in Mfuleni. Residents said a fourth learner who was with the other three was also later hospitalised due to trauma. Police spokesperson André Traut said Mfuleni police were investigating a case of culpable homicide after the accident occurred at about 3.30pm. “Two youths were killed and a third injured when they were struck by a police vehicle. The injured person was admitted to hospital for treatment. The circumstances surrounding the accident are yet to be determined,” Traut said. Community activist Bongisile Njemla said the community had been asking for speed humps to be erected in the area because people have lost lives at the same spot. He said the children were walking home from school. They were walking on the pavement when, according to residents, a speeding police vehicle allegedly overtook a car and hit the children. “Now the families have lost their children because some people think they are above the law,” Njemla said.  “This is not the first incident, by the way, the other time a man was found dead in the early hours and we could see that the person was not stabbed or shot, but had been hit by a car.  “No one saw what happened and it means the person who did that fled the scene, because no one was on the road at that time,” Njemla added. The Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) said they would respond to questions in due course. Cape Times
