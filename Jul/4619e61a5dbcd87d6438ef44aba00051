This was revealed by Justice and Correctional Services Minister Ronald Lamola in his response to parliamentary questions from DA MP Janho Engelbrecht. Engelbrecht asked about the recommended capacity and actual occupation levels of all prison facilities in the country. He also asked about the percentage in each prison and the ratio of prison warders to prisoners.  In his written response, Lamola said the approved bed space in prisons was 108 804 but the country’s prison population was 144 938 as at June 1, up from 141 221 in February when overcrowding was at 27.41%.
