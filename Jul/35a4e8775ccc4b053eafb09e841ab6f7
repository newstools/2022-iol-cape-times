Cape Town – The City of Cape Town is availing a free MyCiTi shuttle service for ticket holders to travel to the DHL Stadium as South Africa takes on Wales this Saturday in the final test match of the Incoming Series. With the national restrictions on gatherings lifted, the DHL Stadium is expected to be at full capacity with a crowd of about 60 000. Parking will be limited in the stadium precinct, and the City has encouraged rugby fans to make use of a park and ride system as well as the Fan Walk to get to the stadium. “I want to say a warm welcome to the Welsh Rugby team, their support staff, and the many fans who have come to watch their team play in one of the most beautiful cities in the world.  “I hope they will take some time out after the game to enjoy the many wonderful restaurants, shops, sites and attractions we have in Cape Town.  Mayco member for safety and security JP Smith added that they encouraged rugby fans to find parking in the CBD, away from the stadium, and take the MyCiTi to the DHL stadium. “Alternatively, show the Cape Town gees in the streets by taking the Fan Walk to the stadium.  “We will be deploying City services to mitigate any traffic congestion, secure the Fan Walk and ensure a safe environment before and after the game,” said Smith. Buses for the free MyCiTi shuttle service for ticket holders to travel to the DHL Stadium, will depart from the Civic Centre and Thibault Square MyCiTi stations from 1.30pm on Saturday. An event shuttle will also operate between the Cape Town International Convention Centre (CTICC) and the stadium. The last return bus will leave the Stadium station at 10pm. Paid parking is also available at the CTICC, Ryk Tulbagh Square, Picbel Parkade (Strand Street), Plein Park (Corporation Street) and the V&A Waterfront. The Fan Walk will be activated from about 1pm before the stadium gates open at 2pm. View a list of road closures at: https://bit.ly/3aDXFZQ Cape Times
