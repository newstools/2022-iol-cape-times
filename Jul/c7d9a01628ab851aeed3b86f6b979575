Cape Town - Metro Police patrol vehicles were damaged and equipment stolen after Manenberg residents surrounded officers and helped a suspect escape on Wednesday. Metro Police spokesperson Ruth Solomons said at around 10:50am officers were patrolling the area due to shooting complaints and spotted a group of men in Manenberg Avenue. As the officers approached, the men attempted to flee, but Metro Police apprehended one suspect and recovered a 9mm Norinco Star pistol and one 9mm live round. “The officers were surrounded by a crowd who managed to help the suspect escape from custody. “In the process, two patrol vehicles were damaged and equipment stolen from the patrol vehicles. “With the assistance from CCTV surveillance, the officers were guided to the suspect’s location further down the road and he was re-arrested,” Solomons said. The 24-year-old was held for the possession of a prohibited firearm and ammunition, and detained at Manenberg SAPS. “Additional charges of malicious damage to property and theft from motor vehicles were laid,” Solomons said. Also on Wednesday, Metro Police officers attached to the K9 unit arrested two suspects for house robbery and recovered a stolen vehicle. “The officers were on patrol when they received intelligence about a house robbery in Goodwood earlier where a vehicle was taken with other household items. “During patrols in Freedom Way, Marconi Beam, vigilant officers spotted the stolen car with two occupants.  They stopped and searched the vehicle. Various household items with the victims’ identity and drivers’ licence were discovered,” Solomons said. A 21-year-old woman and a 35-year-old man were arrested for the possession of a stolen motor vehicle, suspected stolen property, house breaking implements and dangerous weapons and were detained at Milnerton SAPS. Metro police also arrested a 19-year-old for possession of uncut tick worth R50 000 found in his backpack.  Cape Times
