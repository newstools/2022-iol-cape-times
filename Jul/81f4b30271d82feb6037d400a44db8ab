Cape Town - Speeding offences almost doubled on Western Cape roads in the last week. A total of 404 speeding offences were recorded in the province between July 11-17, almost double the number of speeding offences recorded in the province the previous week, Mobility MEC Daylin Mitchell said. Western Cape Provincial Traffic Services implemented a total of 175 integrated roadblocks, vehicle checkpoint and speed control operations across the province in the week and 30 452 vehicles were stopped and checked. Mitchell said 7 987 fines were issued for various traffic violations ranging from driver to vehicle fitness. Twenty-three vehicles were impounded and 39 were discontinued for unroadworthiness. The highest speed recorded in the week was 167 km/h in a 120 km/h zone. Of the 59 total arrests, 41 were for driving under the influence of alcohol and five for speeding. A total of 29 crashes and 30 fatalities were recorded. “I want to send a stern warning to all drivers who are speeding and those who are not complying with the rules of the road. I want to caution drivers and all road users to keep within the speed limit. Speeding is irresponsible and dangerous. “I urge everyone to play a role in improving road safety for pedestrians, cyclists, passengers and drivers. I encourage motorists to be vigilant on the road and pedestrians to make themselves visible to motorists, especially at night and in the early morning,” Mitchell said. Cape Times
