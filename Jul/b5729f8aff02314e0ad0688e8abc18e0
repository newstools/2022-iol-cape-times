Cape Town – Alleged vaccination fraudsters have been arrested in Cape Town and are expected to appear in the Wynberg Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday. Police said detectives received a tip-off about 51-year-old woman from Claremont who had allegedly approached two people, a 33-year-old woman and a 43-year-old man, to arrange for someone to receive the Covid-19 vaccination on her behalf, so that she could obtain the vaccination certificate which was required for travelling purposes. SAPS spokesperson Andrè Traut said the three suspects were arrested by the Provincial Commercial Crime Unit and charged with fraud. A 43-year-old woman who closely resembles the suspect was recruited. She went to a Claremont pharmacy on November 17 last year and received the vaccination. “An investigation into the circumstances of the fraud led to the arrest of the 51-year-old suspect and the two who assisted to arrange the recipient of vaccination, who was paid an amount of R3 000 for her services. “This suspect is still being sought but we believe that her arrest is imminent,” Traut said.
