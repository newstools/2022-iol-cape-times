Cape Town – A Cape Town jazz musician is set to appear in court on charges of rape, sexual assault and sexual grooming, later this year. The musician, who may not be named in the media because of a court order, is still out on R1 000 bail. National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila said the matter had been set down for plea and trial and was postponed to November 30. The Kuils River man, a former director of the Cape Town Music Institute, was arrested in July 2020 after the alleged victim lodged a complaint with the police. The young man alleged that he had been raped and groomed by the musician for about five years. He broke his silence when he took to social media to post a video under the page Say His Name campaign on Facebook. The 23-year-old detailed how had felt like a “pleasuring tool to someone”. “You are just in this space … you’re alone because you can’t cry out … it feels like you are trapped. I was trapped inside myself by not being able to explain that this is happening to me. It was difficult,” said the man. Shortly after his arrest, the accused resigned from his position as the interim national deputy chairperson of the Trade Union for Musicians of SA. Cape Times
