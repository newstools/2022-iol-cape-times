Cape Town - Expanded Public Works Programme (EPWP) workers have assisted the City of Cape Town’s Law Enforcement Graffiti Unit to remove more than 31 000m2 of illegal graffiti in the last year. The City said it recruited several job seekers from sub-council databases to assist the Law Enforcement Graffiti Unit in cleaning illegal graffiti throughout Cape Town. The total budget assigned for EPWP support in this area is approximately R1 million. In the past financial year, which ended in June 2022, the teams succeeded in removing 31 407m2 of graffiti during 130 operations. “Illegal graffiti can have significant negative consequences for communities in Cape Town,” Mayco member for urban waste management, Grant Twigg said. “The practice can create the impression that areas are neglected, and that the community accommodates criminal elements,” said Twigg. He said the City supports public art as it can do a lot to beautify an area, or to inspire and challenge communities. Artists who would like to explore possibilities of public art have been asked to engage with the City or apply for a public art permit.
