Cape Town – Nine-year-old Bonteheuwel figure-skating sensation Tamika van As is seeking funds to realise her dream of representing South Africa in Slovenia in Europe later this year. The Grade 4 learner has been selected to represent South Africa at a club competition in Slovenia for figure skating in November. Her mother, Tarren van As, said they hoped that she can be an inspiration to all. Tamika started pursuing her passion for figure skating from the age of five after stumbling upon the mini-rink at Grand West in Goodwood. “She was at Grand West to support her dad who was coaching a table tennis tournament. Tamika fell in love with skating and soon caught the attention of one of the figure skating coaches, who told her mom Tarren that she had talent and would like to give her some private coaching,” she said. Her biggest dream is to become one of the best skaters in Africa and her family believes her  participation in the upcoming Slovenia figure skating competition will be a bold step in that direction. “Tamika is a very dedicated and hard working person. We wake up at 5.30 four days a week so she can practise before school. She is very passionate about figure skating and she would love to master the triple jump as her journey continues,” said the mother. Her passion, however, has taken a financial toll on her parents. “Covering recurring costs relating to the preparation for an international competition and the cost of travelling is a constant struggle. The sport does not have a sponsor, and the financial burden falls on the parents’ shoulders,” the mother said. The cost involved will include accommodation, flights, competition fees and coaching fees.
