Cape Town - The South African Human Rights Commission is calling for submissions in relation to markers placed by the Department of Home Affairs (DHA) on some identity documents, which strip these people of their legal identity. “Over the years, the Commission has received and investigated complaints relating to the placement of markers on holders’ identity documents,” the Commission said. “In the various complaints received, the identity document holders alleged that their identity documents were endorsed with markers by the DHA without affording them an opportunity to make representations. They further alleged that the endorsements strip them of their legal identity, make it difficult for them to assert their human rights and deny them opportunities for full participation in social and economic life,” it said. The Commission will be embarking on an inquiry to investigate the processes, laws, regulations and policies followed by the DHA, when placing and removing markers on holders’ identity documents. The inquiry is scheduled to take place on September 26 and 27. “To this end, the Commission hereby invites members of the public and civil society organisations to make submissions on their experiences regarding the placement and removal of markers on holders’ identity documents. The submissions should include the impact the placement of markers has had on the affected identity document holders and proposals on how best DHA can handle the placement and removal of markers going forward,” the institution added. Written submissions must be delivered to the Commission by August 16, 2022 at First Floor Allied Building, 34 Brown Street, Allied Building, Mbombela 120 or via email at  tsibanyoni@sahrc.org.za Cape Times
