Cape Town - Four Lesotho nationals have been extradited to face charges of murder and attempted murder in Bonnievale in the Western Cape. SAPS spokesperson Joseph Swartbooi said a woman who sustained serious injuries and the body of a 55-year-old man were found next to a pump house in 2019. The man had been shot in the head. The suspects fled the scene with two firearms and an undisclosed amount of cash. A 29-year-old man was arrested and detained in May 2019. "The investigation team went the extra mile and pursued information which resulted in indications that three persons of interest fled the area the same night of the attack in a bid to evade arrest. "An application for a  warrant of arrest was approved for the imminent arrest of the three persons of interest. "On Friday, December 6, 2019 three males, aged between 25 and 26, were arrested and detained with the assistance of the Lesotho police. "The arrest of the persons of interest paved the way for a marathon extradition enquiry at Mohales Hoek Magistrate’s court in Lesotho. The process was concluded when the extradition of the suspects was finally signed off on Monday, April 25, 2022. "On Monday, July 25, 2022, the three suspects were extradited at the Maseru border, facilitated by Interpol where the warrant of arrest was executed. "Once charged, the suspects are expected to make a court appearance in the Bonnievale Magistrate’s court on the mentioned charges," Swartbooi said. Cape Times
