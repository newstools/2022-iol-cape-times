The ANCYL in the Eastern Cape has condemned the actions of some members it has accused of using the Enyobeni Tavern tragedy for political gain. The Dr WB Rubusana branch said factional battles were coming into play. "Death is the most painful point that any parent or family could experience and we urge all our members to volunteer their time and any available social capital and network they have to solicit sustainable support for these affected families. It should go beyond this moment, including attending the mass funeral scheduled for Wednesday, July 6, without using this platform to fight and gain factional momentum. "The president of the ANC is very welcome to attend and deliver his support in the region, and the ANC Youth League of WB Rubusana distances itself from calls made by Ondela Sokomani to use this platform as a factional spectacle. "Youth development should be at the centre of topics of engagement, not factional agendas." They urged activists not to use the incident for political gain. “We commend the work done so far by this leadership in soliciting widespread social partners to come together and co-ordinate efforts to ensure that these affected families receive dignified burials, social support, care, and rehabilitation.” The Eastern Cape Health Department has confirmed that the last body of the 21 victims of the Enyobeni Tavern tragedy has been identified.  A funeral services will be held for the victims on Wednesday.  Cape Times
