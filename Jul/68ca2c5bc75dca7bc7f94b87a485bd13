Cape Town - The City of Cape Town has warned the public against making prank calls for emergency services, saying they take up valuable time that could be spent attending to actual emergencies. Mayco member for safety and security JP Smith said prank calls had doubled from just 24 the previous weekend, to 55 calls this past weekend. He said sometimes the caller will call and just hang up, at other times they will hurl insults at the emergency operators before ending the call. “Hoax callers are the ones who lie about an emergency and make us waste time dispatching vehicles to an incident that doesn't exist or even to ambush our fire engines. "It’s mind-boggling that prank calls are still so prevalent. We’ve said it time and again – a prank call takes up valuable time that could have been spent attending to an actual emergency. It is simply not funny - no one is laughing, and then of course there’s also a level of abuse that often accompanies these calls. Our emergency operators have a very tough job, and they deal with a lot. This type of time-wasting and abuse is the last thing that they need,” Smith said. The City’s  Public Emergency Communication Centre logged 1 557 incidents over the weekend with calls for medical assistance and by-law complaints accounting for just over 65% of all incidents.
