Cape Town - The Eastern Cape department of Education says it is investigating after three high school boys allegedly gang raped a 13-year-old girl and fellow pupil at the school’s premises in Komani last month. The Maria Louw high school boys were arrested and released on bail following the incident which allegedly occurred at the school’s hostel in June, according to the department. The department said the victim is getting all the necessary support and counselling. The Eastern Cape department of education MEC Fundile Gade condemned the incident. “As the department we will always side with the victim as such we are doing everything in our power to support the family and the victim.  We are trying to speed up our investigation while methodically combing through the critical information and observing the law at the same time”  said Gade. “We shall make sure that justice is served for the victim.  Additionally, we are  observing  that  there's  a  new  pandemic  emerging  in  our  societies. This  pandemic  is  manifesting  itself  through  either  a boy  child  raping  other  fellow   women students  or  the  extraordinary  extreme  two  scenarios  that  of a  male  teacher  raping  or having  an affair  with  the girl  child  or  a women  teacher  having  a  relationship  with  a boy  child  both  of  these  two  are  straight   dismissal  offenses  should  you  be  found  guilty  so  be warned. The department has also opened a case against the alleged perpetrators and as such there is a pending disciplinary hearing against them." Cape Times
