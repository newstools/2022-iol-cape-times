Cape Town - Ageing infrastructure, funding and technical issues have led to water supply interruptions in the Overberg Municipality. The Overberg Water Board said on Thursday it was working to resolve the related issues. It supplies bulk drinking water to the Hessequa and Theewaterskloof Local Municipalities, as well as to around 800 farmers. Board chief executive Dr Phakamani Buthelezi said they would keep stakeholders informed of developments. “Water is central not only as the constitutional right issue, (but) it is in the best interest of all spheres of government to support the initiatives put forward,” Buthelezi said. The board has held consultative meetings with the concerned municipalities, Agri Western Cape, the Department of Water and Sanitation and the Western Cape Department of Local Government. “The Overberg Water Board is one of the nine national water boards within the Department of Water and Sanitation and is working tirelessly towards addressing the current water supply interruptions in its area of operation. “(The board) has experienced water supply interruptions mainly due to ageing infrastructure, funding and technical challenges,” the board said. Meanwhile the Department of Water and Sanitation said on Tuesday that the Theewaterskloof Dam level stood at 76.03 percent, a notable drop compared to 102% last year. This as the Gouritz River Catchment System, which includes the Central and Little Karoo plus the coastal belt, reflected 46.08% – an encouraging improvement from 23.96% last year. The Western Cape’s water supply system reached 75.41% this week, an increase of 1%. Cape Times
