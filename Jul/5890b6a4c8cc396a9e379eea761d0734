Cape Town – Two teenagers behind a vicious dog fight have been identified by the NSPCA who are determined to seek justice. On July 8, a graphic video of dog fighting was forwarded to the NSPCA’s Special Investigations Unit by a detective at the Aliwal North police station in the Eastern Cape. In the video, the teenagers can be seen inciting their two large-breed pit bulls to attack a dog that they had chained up. The dog can be heard screaming in pain and terror as the pit bulls repeatedly tear into its flesh. The teenagers are seen laughing and encouraging their blood-covered pit bulls to continue attacking the chained dog, until eventually its bones could be heard being crushed and the dog dies. “It was later discovered that the teen duo had stolen the dog from their neighbour, taken it to a veld and chained it,” the NSPCA said. On July 9, the NSPCA and SAPS raided the teenager’s homes in Joe Gqabi. The pit bulls seen in the video were found chained up and were removed by the NSPCA, along with another dog found on one of the properties, the NSPCA said. Although the teenagers are under the age of 18, the NSPCA said it would still seek justice. “The NSPCA intends to lay criminal charges against both the boys and three other spectators. For the dog which lost its life as well the two pit bulls that were subjected to being used for illegal dog fighting." Cape Times
