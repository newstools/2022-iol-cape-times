Cape Town - What was supposed to be a smooth resumption of a section of the Central Line corridor on Tuesday was marred by long delays due to technical glitches and a power trip. “If I have to dismiss some people, I will do it. If I’m not happy and not convinced, you will need to justify why you are here and what you are doing,” Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula scolded the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) board. Mbalula conducted an oversight visit of the partial reopening of Cape Town to Langa (via Pinelands), and Langa to Bellville (via Sarepta) lines after being closed in 2019 due to extensive vandalism and theft, as well as illegal occupations on the rail network.

The train was stuck for about 30 minutes. “I’m hard on the Prasa management because I think they can do better; they are not where I want them to be. There are people who are sleeping on the job but then you also have individuals that are passionate and have knowledge about their job. This is a trial run and we saw some challenges,” he said. Mbalula said he would return to the province after two weeks. “What is important is that trains must run on time. "We saw how young schoolchildren were excited to see the train back on the line after two years of not seeing them.” Mobility MEC Daylin Mitchell, who was part of the train ride, said the railway service was "once upon a time" the backbone of the province, and remained hopeful the glitches will be sorted.
