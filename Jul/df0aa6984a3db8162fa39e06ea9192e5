Cape Town - Police are searching for the accomplices of a man who appeared in court on Wednesday for a triple murder in Khayelitsha. SAPS spokesperson Andrè Traut said the 30-year-old suspect appeared in the Khayelitsha Magistrate’s Court after he was arrested on Monday evening during a tracing operation in the area. He has been charged with three counts of murder following an incident on the corners of Nyebelele and Ntengu Streets in Site C Khayelitsha on July 16. Three men, Kwezi Mphummzi, 34, Mveleli Nobuzana, 36, and Howard Mjamba, 50, were gunned down during the mass murder, which sent detectives on a manhunt for the perpetrators. “While the arrested suspect, who was previously convicted back in 2017 for the possession of an unlicensed firearm, is making his first court appearance today, our detectives from Provincial Organised Crime are hard at work in pursuit of his accomplices. The incident was suspected to be linked to the drug trade in the area. Khayelitsha Development Forum (KDF) spokesperson Ndithini Tyidopreviously said crime was a concern in the area. The same night that the men were killed, two men in their thirties were shot and killed in Tutu Avenue, Harare. In Citrusdal in the Cederberg, three men were shot and killed in an informal dwelling.
