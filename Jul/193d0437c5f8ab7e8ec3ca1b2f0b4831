Cape Town - The board of the Vygieskraal Cemetery in Johnston Road, Athlone, is calling on residents to report any suspicious activity following repeated vandalism at the graveyard. In the latest incident, the cemetery’s lights were stolen.  Board chairperson Abdullah Salie said load shedding had exacerbated the security issues at the cemetery. He said the vandals were cutting the poles at the cemetery to steal the lights.  “We are looking for sponsors that can help us install an inverter on the premises. That means that the lights will stay on during load shedding,” said Salie.  Salima Modack, an executive member of the Rylands Gatesville Civic Association,  said they have recorded three incidents in July. Modack said graves were often damaged and cables and drain covers stolen. “It was a regular occurrence especially during the national lockdown with the illegal occupation of the City-owned land neighbouring the cemetery.  “Vagrants used to frequent the area and sleep on the piece of land and that's when the complaints started,” he said.  “We have been appealing to the City since 2017 for them to properly secure the vacant land, remove the illegal dwellers and together with SAPS provide more visible policing and enforcement of by-laws.  “The general derelict state of the length of Klipfontein Road also contributes to criminality.”  City mayoral committee member for Safety and Security JP Smith said, however, that they were not allowed to remove the structures without eviction applications. “This is as the court ruled. We can now again counter-spoliate new ones being established but those built during lockdown that took advantage of regulations and court interdict have to have evictions applications. We have submitted hundreds of applications for sites such as this one,” he said.  Counter-spoliation is a legal remedy which allows a person to forcibly re-take possession of property unlawfully taken from them. Cape Times
