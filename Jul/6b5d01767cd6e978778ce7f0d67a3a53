Cape Town - The four men accused of the murder of Igshaan Philander at the Synergy Rehabiliitation and Upliftment Centre will be back in the Goodwood Magistrate’s Court in August, after the case was postponed again. Wednesday’s court date had been due to a prior postponement which called for further investigation. All accused have been denied bail. Philander, 36, was a patient at the illegal , unregistered rehabilitation centre which operated out of a residence in Louis Botha Street, Ruyterwacht. According to reports, when Philander’s family enquired about him, he could not be found and he was subsequently reported missing in November last year. When police visited the centre, a number of residents had made claims of abuse. National Prosecuting Authority, Eric Ntabazalila said the case against Zaid Isaacs, Moegamat Ismail Jones, Moegamat Rafiek Ishmail and Vuyani Kedama who are charged with the murder of Philander at the centre, was postponed to August 23, 2022 for further investigation. Elsies River Community Police Forum spokesperson Imraahn Mukaddam called for better oversight of rehabilitation centres. “There are rehabs that are operating outside of the law and cannot guarantee the safety of their clients which is a problem. “There is a need for better regulation because there is a loophole in the system where rehabs are established without all the checks and balances in place.” “Even at registered rehabs, you have clients that are subject to abuse where people have died. “Booking your loved ones into rehabs out of genuine concern, you need to ensure that the rehab has the necessary system in place because your loved ones might be subject to possible violence from others at the centre. “Someone needs to police these rehabs to make sure the clients are safe,” Mukaddam said.
