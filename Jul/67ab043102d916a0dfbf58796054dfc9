Cape Town - The murder of a foreign-national shopkeeper in Clarke Estate, Elsies River this week has sparked an outcry in the community. Police said the motive for the killing on Tuesday was a “possible robbery”, while the suspects remain at large. Police spokesperson FC van Wyk said: “At about 7.30am, Elsies River SAPS members received a complaint of a shooting at a supermarket, in Adriaanse Road, Clark Estate, Elsies River. On their arrival they found the deceased lying in the store behind the counter. “The 24-year-old deceased had gunshot wounds to his body. A murder case was opened for investigation. The unknown suspect(s) who fled the scene in an unknown direction are yet to be arrested. The motive can be possibly robbery.” It is unclear whether the suspects made off with any valuables. CPF spokesperson Imraahn Mukaddam said the murder had rocked the community. “We, the Elsies River CPF, dip our heads once again as a young shopkeeper here in Clarke Estate met a brutal end to his life.  “Mohamed Hoosain was shot multiple times in the face a short while after opening the well-known Mahmood Shop in Clarke Estate. “This is tragic and we as members of this community cannot accept this. The killing of a shopkeeper serving our essential needs is a crisis. The CPF condemns this brutal act in the strongest terms. It is cowardice as it happened early during load shedding. We are pained that this attack occurred at a time when most of our families rush to the shop before going on their daily duties,” said Mukaddam. The structure has now called on the community to rally their support around the CPF, neighbourhood watches and street committees to strengthen SAPS and law enforcement “to bring peace and safety in the community”.
