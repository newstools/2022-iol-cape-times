Cape Town - Parow community activists and the police’s Anti Gang Unit (AGU) are seeking the public’s help to identify the bodies of two unknown men found under a bridge in Parow. The two victims, with stab wounds, were found wrapped in blankets on Monday.  Police spokesperson Joseph Swartbooi said both victims were declared deceased on the scene by the medical personnel. “Parow police attended a complaint on Monday, July 18, 2022. Upon arrival at the scene in Cloete Street, they found the bodies of two unknown males wrapped in blankets who sustained stab wounds to their bodies,” said Swartbooi. Parow community activist Franchesca Walker said the community needed to have a campaign to call for the end of brutal crime in the area. “This kind of heinous act shocked the community, I mean who would kill people and dump them? And what is worse is that they were wrapped with blankets.  “The matter needs serious intervention from the police and we cannot by any means allow or make it a norm that we have dumped bodies in our area. The people who have done this need to be taught a lesson by being harshly sentenced for the crime they did, and by the way, you would find out that this was not their first murder.  “The community will need to have tight security to avoid such things and we call on whoever has  information regarding this to work with the police, or they can contact some community leaders so the matter can be taken to the police station,” said Walker. Anyone  with information that can assist with the investigation is requested to call the investigation officer, Sergeant Bradley Schuurman, on 071 673 3841 or Crime Stop on 08600 10111 Cape Times
