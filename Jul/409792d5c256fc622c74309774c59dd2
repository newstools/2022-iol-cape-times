Cape Town - Following two separate mass shootings in the province at the weekend, the SAPS have launched a 72-hour activation plan to probe the circumstances that claimed the lives of six people. In Citrusdal in the Cederberg, police spokesperson Andrè Traut, said three men were shot and killed in an informal dwelling. "During the early hours of (Saturday) morning, the three victims, all believed to be Lesotho nationals, were shot and killed at their informal dwelling in Riverview.  “It is believed that a fourth male also sustained a gunshot wound, but managed to escape the attack. This victim is yet to be traced. The suspect or suspects fled the scene and are yet to be apprehended. The motive for the murders are not yet established," said Traut. The SAPS are also investigating a triple murder in Khayelitsha on Saturday evening. "At approximately 8.30pm three men - aged 34, 36 and 50 -- were gunned down on the corner of Nyebelele and Ntango streets in Site C by suspects who are yet to be arrested. At this stage it is not yet clear what led to the attack on the victims," said Traut. In an unrelated incident, Traut said, two men in their thirties were shot and killed in Tutu Avenue, Makhaza, in Harare at around 9.35pm on Saturday. "The victims were driving in a blue Hyundai sedan when they came under attack by the occupants in a white VW Polo, who fled the scene.  “One of the victims died on the scene while the other one succumbed to death shortly after being admitted to hospital. We have reason to believe that the incident could be linked to the drug trade in the area, but this will be established as our investigation unfolds," said Traut. An appeal has been made to the public to come forward with information that can assist SAPS with their investigation in these cases.
