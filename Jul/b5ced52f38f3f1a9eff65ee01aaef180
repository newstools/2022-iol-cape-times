Cape Town - The South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) has called for submissions in its inquiry into child malnutrition in the Eastern Cape. The SAHRC on Wednesday said they had received complaints in the province, coupled with various media reports pertaining to the deaths of children due to Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) caused by hunger. “Studies and statistics further indicate that many children in the province are malnourished as a result of living in abject poverty. “Despite this tragedy, it appears that the Department of Social Development forfeited an amount of R67 million of unspent funds to National Treasury in the previous financial year,” the SAHRC said. “In view thereof, and in line with the Commission’s mandate, the Commission has resolved to host a Provincial Inquiry Into the Right to Food and Child Malnutrition.” The inquiry seeks to ventilate the root causes and identify possible solutions and/or measures by the relevant role players to decrease the prevalence of SAM and eradicate these unnecessary deaths. The SAHRC said it also aims to hold to account the relevant implementing stakeholders who may be neglecting in realising their respective mandates in order to address and prevent these prevailing apparent human rights violations. The inquiry is scheduled to take place on 8 to 12 August 2022 at the Eastern Cape Provincial Office Boardroom. “The commission invites members of the public, civil society organisations and interested parties with relevant information relating to the inquiry to make submissions to the panel for consideration as well as potential follow- up and participation,” the SAHRC said. Written submissions must be delivered to the Commission by 29 July 2022 to the following addresses: Physical Address: 13 Phillip Frame Road, First Floor Waverly Park, Cambridge Chiselhurst, East London, 5247 or via email: ntyulu@sahrc.org.za and lmpondo@sahrc.org.za Cape Times
