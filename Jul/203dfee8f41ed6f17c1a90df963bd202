Cape Town - As the 21 young people who died at the Enyobeni Tavern in East London were laid to rest on Wednesday, the Eastern Cape health department said it would provide the families with information about what led to the deaths as soon as it was available. “It is very important that we base our findings from the evidence that has been collected from those results. "It is for that reason that we are pleading we wait for those results and not speculate,” deputy director-general for clinical services Dr Litha Matiwane said. President Cyril Ramaphosa called for relevant regulatory bodies to ensure that alcohol is not marketed or sold to children and adolescents. “These were not only the children of their families, of Scenery Park, and of East London. Ibingabantwana bethu sonke (They were our children). And that is why I am here. That is why we are all here. We are not here to play politics. We are not here to judge anyone for what they did or did not do for their children or for their friends on the night of the 26th of June 2022.  “We are here to mourn the 21 young people who died. Each and every one of them had a beautiful soul. They each had beautiful dreams. They each had a bright future ahead of them,” Ramaphosa said. The grieving families of the deceased took the front row seats inside the gigantic marquee pitched for the emotional ceremony at the Scenery Park sports ground.
