Cape Town - Police say more arrests are imminent following the discovery of truck tyres worth R1.5 million at a Du Noon warehouse this week, linked to truck-jacking cases reported in Bellville and Mfuleni. On Tuesday at around 10am, members of the Provincial Serious and Violent Crimes Investigation Unit followed up intelligence of alleged stolen truck tyres kept at a storage facility in McLaren Street, Du Noon, police spokesperson Frederick van Wyk said. On arrival at the premises, it was found to be locked and police could not gain access to it. “They conducted surveillance from a nearby parking area until they observed the arrival of an unknown male at the facility, who had keys to unlock the gates and doors in his possession. The members approached the storage facility once the unknown male unlocked and entered the facility and found truck tyres to the estimated value of R1.5 million inside,” Van Wyk said. A known bus company utilised the warehouse to do repairs on their buses and a stolen tyre was found fitted on one of the buses, Van Wyk said. “The recovered tyres are linked to truck-jacking cases reported at Bellville and Mfuleni SAPS,” he said. A 45-year-old man was arrested and will appear in court once charged. “Further arrests are imminent,” Van Wyk said. Cape Times
