Cape Town – The former police officer accused of killing a constable and two patients at New Somerset hospital in Cape Town has revealed that the medication he's taking has been assisting him following claims of being suicidal. Jean-Paul Malgas made a brief appearance wearing a grey jacket and red hoodie at the Cape Town Magistrate’s Court on Thursday via Audio Visual Remand (AVR) system. The 39 year old who is in Pollsmoor looked better compared to his first court appearance in May. Malgas faces three charges of murder, a charge of illegal possession of a firearm, a charge of illegal possession of ammunition and robbery. The robbery charge stems from when he allegedly disarmed Sea Point Constable Donay Phillips, who was at the hospital safeguarding a suspect. Malgas was a patient at the Hospital when he allegedly shot the cop and proceeded to shoot two patients. State prosecutor Adenaan Gelderbloem told the court that an agreement was reached with Malgas’s  lawyer, Shaun Balram to postpone the case for further investigation until August 12. “The state has received one post-mortem report so far and is waiting for two that are outstanding.  “Ballistic report, DNA report and prima residue report are outstanding.  “The State has received about 5 witness statements so far.  “The identity parade is also still outstanding,” said Gelderbloem. Balram questioned Malgas about his health claiming he was suicidal before. “How are you doing and feeling today?  “I will come see you soon.” Malgas said he was getting better as he was taking treatment. “I’m on medication and it is helping me get better,” he said. National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila said Malgas did not say if he was changing his position of not wanting bail, but if he did, the State would oppose his bail application.
