Cape Town - Heideveld community activist Vanessa Nelson has blamed the government for police being under-resourced, especially on the Cape Flats, after a 16-year-old boy was killed in gang crossfire at the weekend. Police spokesperson FC van Wyk said a murder case had been opened for investigation and no arrests had been made. “Circumstances surrounding a shooting incident on Sunday, where a 16-year-old boy was shot and fatally wounded in the parking area of Linda Court, Heideveld, Manenberg, are under investigation. The possibility that this incident can be gang-related will be investigated,” said Van Wyk. Nelson said police in the area were working hard with the community to curb crime in the area but they were under-resourced. “There is no plan on reducing the increase of violence in our community. As organisations, SAPS and Community Police Forum (CPF), we have had candle lighting (vigils) many times praying to end crime, especially gang-violence crime. The SAPS are working with us all the time. They are always available and accessible when we need assistance and so does law enforcement. “Every week a person dies in our area, whether it’s an innocent person or a gangster. The problem is that the gang war is out of control. We don’t know the cause and motive behind gang shootings in our areas.” In an unrelated incident in Delft, two youth between the ages of 19 and 23 were shot and killed on Sunday at around 4.50pm while two others were wounded when unknown suspects opened fire at them at Stellenbosch Arterial in Freedom Farm. “The circumstances are being investigated and arrests are yet to be made,” said police spokesperson Andre Traut.
