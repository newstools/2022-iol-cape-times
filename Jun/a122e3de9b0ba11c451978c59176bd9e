Cape Town - “I fear for my life,” says a traumatised e-hailing driver who is finding it hard to return to duty after being involved in a robbery and attempted hijacking in Browns Farm, Philippi recently. While tempers flare among communities related to attempted kidnappings and hijackings, the attacked e-hailing driver who did not want to be named out of fear of victimisation, said he fears for his life and his colleagues as their jobs have become “more dangerous” in recent months. Police confirmed the incident is under investigation. The driver said he had picked up the passengers - one of whom had a broken arm - at hospital. “They told me it was their first time and were unsure how to go about the booking. They then begged me to take them home as they were desperate to get home. They paid their trip fee of R126 up front and said I must please drop them at Browns Farm. I am unfamiliar with that area and asked them where it is. They said it was near the airport and I assumed it was safe because that is the safer area and vicinity to drop people,” said the driver. However, his ordeal started five minutes before the trip had to end when the two passengers launched their attack on the man. “I was taken to drive in Philippi and we ended up at a dead end where they tied my hands behind the seat with a rope while ransacking the car for valuables. All of this was happening in full view of people living around there. They did nothing as they must have feared the firearm the one suspect had. They also tried to take my car but did not succeed as the ignition system on the Toyota Rush is keyless. They tried to hot wire it but that made the alarm sound and they ran off. I fear for my life,” said the driver. Police spokesperson FC van Wyk, said: “Nyanga SAPS is investigating a case of attempted carjacking and robbery. The circumstances surrounding this incident are under investigation. The suspects fled the scene and are yet to be arrested.” Cape Times
