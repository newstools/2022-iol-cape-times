Cape Town - The City of Cape Town will immediately drop the remaining Covid-19 restrictions at City facilities, including capacity limitations, wearing of face masks and compulsory hand sanitising at entrances, following Health Minister Dr Joe Phaahla’s repeal of the remaining Covid restrictions on Wednesday. In a statement on Thursday, Cape Town Mayor Geordin Hill-Lewis welcomed the move and said the City would immediately lift all remaining restriction measures at its facilities and buildings. “This includes capacity limitations at facilities, the compulsory wearing of face masks and compulsory hand sanitising at the entrances to facilities. “This means residents will once again be able to fill our stadia, sports facilities, clinic waiting rooms, payment halls and so on,” Hill-Lewis said. He said due to Covid-19 restrictions and capacity limitations. People have, at times, had to queue for long periods of time outside in the hot sun, cold wind and rain at clinics, motor licensing facilities and walk-in centres. “Our Safe Spaces for homeless residents have not been able to operate at full capacity. Our entertainment industry has suffered, and many people have been unable to attend sports events because of restrictions on theatres and stadiums. “The decision to repeal the remaining regulations is long overdue,” Hill-Lewis said. Premier Alan Winde also welcomed the decision, which followed Wednesday’s President’s Coordinating Council (PCC) meeting. “It is now up to all residents to use the lessons they have learnt over the past two years to keep themselves safe. It is about individual responsibility,” Winde said. “I can't wait to hear the roar of a packed sports stadium, the buzz of a theatre filled to capacity and conference centres humming with activity again. “It must now be about the economy and creating as many jobs as possible,” Winde added.
