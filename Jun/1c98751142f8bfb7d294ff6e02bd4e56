Cape Town - Embattled airline Comair says it has reached an agreement with Airlink to accommodate passengers holding a British Airways flight for travel between June 7 and 12, who have been affected by Comair’s suspension. British Airways customers affected by the temporary suspension of Comair services have the option to rebook with Airlink at no additional cost, subject to availability. British Airways has also arranged for any of its international customers who had booked regional or domestic connecting flights with Comair to be accommodated on SAA. Meanwhile, kulula.com has confirmed that any customers who booked tickets before flights were suspended will be refunded by the end of this week. “We understand the negative perceptions created by the Kulula ticket sale even though the sale had been triggered a week earlier. Bearing in mind that Comair only receives the money once the flights are flown, we have agreed with our bankers to release the funds back to our customers and we are pleased to advise that the refund process will commence immediately,” said Comair chief executive Glenn Orsmond. He added that Comair had also extended Travel Bank credits due to expire in June by a month. Affected customers who would like to rebook can contact the British Airways International Contact Centre, who will support Comair in managing incoming calls, on 010 344 0130, or their travel agent. The refund policy remains the same: For customers on British Airways flights, British Airways’ booking with confidence policy will apply. Details can be found here: https://bit.ly/36cfJYC.
