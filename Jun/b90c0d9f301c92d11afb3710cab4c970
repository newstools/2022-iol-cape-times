Cape Town – Beaches in Plettenberg Bay have been closed after a local man was killed in a shark attack on Tuesday. The NSRI said just after 2pm on Tuesday, its Plettenberg Bay duty crew were activated following eyewitness reports of a shark incident involving a swimmer at Sanctuary Beach, on the Robberg side of Plettenberg Bay. Rescue swimmers responded directly to the scene, and two NSRI rescue craft were launched. “Upon arrival at the scene the body of an adult male, believed to be a local man, was located and recovered from the water at the back surf line, and put onto an NSRI rescue craft,” the NSRI said. “The body was brought to the NSRI Plettenberg Bay rescue station, and a NSRI doctor, the Western Cape government health EMS, and the SAPS responded. “Unfortunately, the man sustained fatal injuries and was declared deceased by the doctor.” The man’s family were receiving counselling and support from the SAPS. “We convey our condolences to the family of the deceased,” the NSRI said. The Bitou Municipality shared the NSRI’s statement on Facebook, as it appealed to bathers, paddlers, sailors and boaters in Plettenberg Bay and along the Southern Cape coastline to exercise caution following the fatal incident. Some beaches have been temporarily closed in the meantime.
