Cape Town, Bellville, Malmesbury, Mitchells Plain and Khayelitsha Home Affairs offices are among the list of offices that will be open for two additional hours, until 6pm, until July 15. Home Affairs Minister Aaron Motsoaledi has approved the extension of the operating period for smart ID card and passport applications and collections only. The extension of operating hours excludes weekends. “This extension is critical for service delivery. It is part of our many strategies to eliminate long queues at our offices while ensuring that people receive the enabling documents they apply for. We will ensure that every client that is inside these selected offices at the time of closing receives services,” Motsoaledi said. During school holidays, the Department of Home Affairs experiences an increase in demand for its products, especially from parents applying for documents for their children. Parents are encouraged to use the Branch Appointment Booking System to schedule their visits to Home Affairs offices.
