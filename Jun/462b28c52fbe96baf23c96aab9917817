Cape Town - Family and friends of Emmanuel Moeurs remembered him during a memorial service on Thursday, after he was stabbed to death in Kraaifontein, allegedly after “refusing to use the women’s toilets” because he was gay. The 24-year-old from Wallacedene was ‘ordered’ by his attacker to leave a male toilet at a local tavern on May 29 because of his sexual orientation. It is believed that this is when the suspect got into a physical fight with Moeurs, who was stabbed several times. Police spokesperson FC Van Wyk said: “The circumstances surrounding the incident are still under investigation but preliminary information suggests that a previous homophobic comment might be the motive for the attack. “The victim is a 24-year-old male resident of Wallacedene, Kraaifontein. Investigations continue,” said Van Wyk. Moeurs’ relative, Susan Pienaar said the suspect previously threatened to beat Moeurs because he was gay. “For us, as family, we have lost a beautiful soul, somebody who could not even hurt a fly, somebody who would light up your morning or your whole day, and now we will never hear his beautiful voice that used to sing Xhosa gospel and wake you up in the morning. “That person is gone and we will never see him, we will only have beautiful memories of him. The killer is still walking free outside,” she said. LGBTQIA+ activist Kamva Gwana said they needed to lobby government and the private sector to help reduce these crimes. “Hate crime is a crisis against the LGBTQI+ people in this country, it's ongoing and it has not slowed down but rather the momentum of responses is slowing down and that is the first thing we would like to condemn. We need the government not to tire in their response, or at least they must promise to respond and prevent these types of crimes,” said Gwana. Cape Times
