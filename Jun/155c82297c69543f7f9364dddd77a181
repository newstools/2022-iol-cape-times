Cape Town - The Police Ministry was expected to visit East London on Sunday afternoon after at least 22 people, most of them reportedly youths, were killed in a stampede. The stampede at the Enyobeni Tavern in East London was described by some as a “bizarre” occurrence. Police spokesperson Thembinkosi Kinana said that the circumstances around the deaths were still unknown. “It’s a shock. The community has gathered here out of concern of what has happened. “Indeed we received, as the police, a report in the early hours of (Sunday), that children have been found in one of the local taverns here. “The circumstances surrounding the incident are under investigation. At this stage we cannot speculate in terms of what has happened. “At this stage our investigating officers are still combing the scene trying to find out. They will advise us very soon in terms of what is being investigated,” Kinana told the SABC during an interview on Sunday morning. Parents were waiting on Sunday morning to hear whether their children were among those who had died in the incident. Eastern Cape Police Commissioner Major-General Nomthetheleli Mene said police received a call about the incident at about 4am. “We are waiting for the investigation to continue. That will then guide us on what type of crime we will register as police.” This is a developing story. Cape Times
