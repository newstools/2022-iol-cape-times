Cape Town - The City of Cape Town’s Health Department says it is working closely with other spheres of government and the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) to manage any potential outbreak of Monkeypox in the metropole. Cape Town this week recorded the country’s second case of Monkeypox, in a 32-year-old man with no travel history. Monkeypox can spread from animals to humans, and also between people. “City Health Outbreak response teams, which include Primary Health Care and Environmental Health Services will assist in case management and contact tracing, similar to what was done during the Covid-19 pandemic, and investigate localised outbreaks in congregate settings,” the Cape Town Municipality said. Community Services and Health Mayco member, Patricia Van der Ross, said if people were unsure what to do, they should rather seek advice at the nearest clinic or private health service provider. “The news of our first case of Monkeypox will no doubt cause some concern and anxiety for our residents. It’s important to note that due to the low risk of transmission, a wide-spread outbreak of Monkeypox is highly unlikely.  “City Health will do everything possible to help mitigate the impact of the virus. Our health response was severely tested during the Covid-19 pandemic, and I think the experiences will be extremely valuable in managing any future disease outbreaks.  “However, we remind the public that health is a shared responsibility. Please do ensure that you are alert to the signs and symptoms of Monkeypox, and help create awareness within your family and community, without fear-mongering or judgement, and steer clear of spreading fake news. If you are unsure what to do, seek advice at your nearest clinic or private health service provider,” Van der Ross said.
