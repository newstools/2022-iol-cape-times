Cape Town - Plans to erect a cellphone mast near Sir Lowry’s Pass Primary School have been put on ice after it emerged that the school did not get the go ahead from the Western Cape Education Department (WCED). A grandparent has welcomed this, saying it posed a health risk. The WCED said  while the school had followed other processes, it had not applied to the Education MEC David Maynier’s office for approval. John Magwebu, a concerned grandparent and member of the South African National Civic Organisation (Sanco), said that he will fight to stop the project until the end. “I think it is insane to put a project like this in a school property, everything in a 15 metre radius in that particular area is an endangerment in the long run. “I have ten grandchildren at the school so there is absolutely no way I will agree to something that is a detriment to my children or any other children. “Causes such as radiation are a health risk, so that is why we complained. “Anybody in their right mind can think that a tower that is 15 metres high will have an effect on the people underneath it in the community.” In a written reply to ANC education spokesperson Khalid Sayed, Maynier said a health and environment study had been conducted. Maynier’s spokesperson Kelly Mauchline said: “The (MEC) of Education has to approve the construction of physical infrastructure on school property, as per the South African Schools Act. Other processes relating to cellphone masts (including public participation processes and safety) are dealt with by the municipality according to national regulations. “While the school had followed the other processes, it had not applied to the (MECs) office for approval. The school was thus asked to stop the works until the necessary approval has been obtained,” she said. Cape Times
