Cape Town - Two suspects appeared in court on Monday on charges of perjury after making false cases of hijacking and kidnapping at Woodstock Police Station. Police spokesperson Frederick van Wyk said this should serve as a warning to the public to refrain from making false cases. He said the two suspects reported a hijacking and kidnapping case at Woodstock police on May 23 and the matter was transferred to the Western Cape Serious and Violent Crimes Investigations Unit for further investigation. “During the investigation it became clear after comparing the tracker reports of the suspects’ vehicle and the delivery vehicles tracker reports that there is a time delay. The suspects were not able to follow them at all to commit the mentioned crime," said Van Wyk Upon further investigation on Thursday last week, Van Wyk said the victims were interviewed and confronted with the facts. "They then admitted opening a false case because they were parked in Liesbeek Park Way and had their lunch. According to their reports while standing at the crime scene as mentioned the suspects pulled up and robbed them and took the companies parcels. They staged a hijacking and kidnapping to prevent disciplinary action by their employer as they were not supposed to be at the mentioned location.” On the same day, the two suspects aged 24 and 31, were arrested after the investigation officer registered a case of perjury against them. “They will appear in the Cape Town Magistrates court on the mentioned charges," said Van Wyk.
