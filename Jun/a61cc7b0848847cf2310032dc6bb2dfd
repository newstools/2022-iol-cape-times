Cape Town - The Cape Town City Ballet (CTCB) has hailed its patron, Dr Cornelia (Connie) September, for being awarded her doctoral thesis in education at the age of 61. A passionate philomath, September received her doctoral degree in the Management of Technology and Innovation in Education, at the Da Vinci Institute, in Johannesburg, in May. Her thesis was titled: ‘Public Funding of the College Sector: a social-return-on-investment in higher education in South Africa’. She is one of CTCB’s three patrons, and a champion of the arts and ballet sectors. September said sessions of the course started in 2019. “I was always interested to learn more to study further hence obtaining a pre-primary teachers diploma, economic degrees, post-graduate economic policy degrees, Masters in applying technology management in townships and now PhD in education. Education became my life in the unions and in Parliament.” It was a great achievement to complete my PhD at the age of 61, she said. She said she had served on the Magistrates Commission for five years and was responsible for ensuring that more women and especially young black women and men enter the bench in the lower courts. “Some of them are now serving in the higher courts. We were praised by the president for the changes we made.” September said she would continue to study and also encouraged others to keep on studying but to also use their knowledge to teach. “I will keenly work to get the recommendations of my thesis implemented.” Cape Town City Ballet chief executive Debbie Turner said: “Dr September has been an integral part of the classical ballet world for many years through her unwavering commitment to the investment in the industry. Her work continues to help advance the sector through many avenues. Connie, we are proud and honoured to have you as our patron. We salute you for this immense achievement of being awarded your doctoral degree.” Cape Times
