Cape Town - Parliament has received a complaint from EFF chief whip Floyd Shivambu calling for an investigation into allegations of gender-based violence (GBV) against female MPs, allegedly by some parliamentary protection officers. On Monday, parliamentary spokesperson Moloto Mothapo said the complaint, lodged with National Assembly Speaker Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, arose from the ejection of MPs during the chaotic presidency budget vote debate on Thursday and Friday. Mothapo said MPs Babalwa Mathulelwa, Noluvuyo Tafeni and Naledi Chirwa were allegedly violated during the sittings. “The three had to be removed from the Chamber for a highly disruptive behaviour which saw the debate on the presidency budget vote delayed by over an hour, and the subsequent reply by the president the day after being temporarily suspended,” he said. Mothapo said Mapisa-Nqakula has also been advised two parliamentary protection services personnel, Khunjulwa Sinono and Khaya Honey Vanqa, suffered abuse, assault and intimidation from the EFF MPs. “Ms Sinino, in particular, sustained an injury to her face after being allegedly assaulted by a male EFF MP. She immediately received medical attention, and both have since opened criminal cases with the Cape Town police.” Mothapo said Mapisa-Nqakula was highly disturbed by the allegations and said no stone would be left unturned in establishing all the factual circumstances. “Gender-based violence, whether committed against female members of Parliament or female members of staff, must be condemned in the strongest terms.” He also said Mapisa-Nqakula has committed to swiftly institute an internal investigation into all the allegations. and prestige of Parliament in the eyes of the public,” Mothapo said.
