Staff Reporter THERE is no sign of a 26-year-old missing fisherman who was swept off the rocks by waves at Klein Voelklip near Herolds Bay on Friday. The National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI), Wilderness Station Commander, Mike Vonk, said just before 2pm on Friday, that the duty crew responded to reports of a fisherman swept off rocks at Klein Voelklip. The NSRI launched two sea-rescue crafts, rescue swimmers and shore crew, while police, George Fire and Rescue Services and Western Cape Government Health EMS ambulance and their rescue squad also responded to the scene. “On arrival at the scene, a sea and shoreline search commenced for a 26-year-old George man. “Friends of the man, fellow anglers, confirmed that while fishing along the shoreline a wave had swept over the man and he had been swept into the sea before they lost sight of him. They had immediately raised the alarm,” Vonk said. During an extensive search, a Police Dive Unit was activated and they also joined in the search operation. However, despite an extensive search there remains no sign of the missing man, Vonk said. On Saturday, police divers were joined by NSRI Wilderness crew who launched the sea rescue craft Spirit of Rotary 100 and V's Rescuer and are assisting police divers in the ongoing search. “Police divers have free dived at the search area in their ongoing search efforts and sea and shoreline search efforts are also ongoing. “Thoughts are with the family and friends of the missing man in this difficult time,” Vonk said. Police have opened an investigation. Cape Times
