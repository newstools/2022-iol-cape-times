Cape Town - Two alleged cash-in-transit robbers are set to appear in the Paarl Magistrate’s Court following a robbery at a liquor store in Franschhoek this week. Hawks spokesperson Zinzi Hani said the two were arrested on Wednesday after a robbery at the Diamond Discount Liquor store. “The crewman was attacked by three suspects while entering the armoured vehicle. In the process the crewman dropped the canister box. “The suspects then collected the box and ran away, which was later recovered at a short distance from the crime scene,” Hani said. It is reported that the Fidelity armed vehicle gave chase and rammed the Ford Ka straight after the attempted robbery as it was fleeing the scene. “The Ford Ka managed to flee. “The suspects were on foot when they were spotted by members of the community who alerted the security in the area,” Hani said. Police and a local security company arrested the suspects. “The two suspects were ultimately arrested and the Ford Ka fled the scene but was later found abandoned. “The Hawks’ were informed and took over the case for further investigation,” Hani said. The two suspects were detained and will appear in the Paarl Magistrate’s Court on Friday.  Cape Times
