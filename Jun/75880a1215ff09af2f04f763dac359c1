Cape Town - The Cape of Good Hope SPCA has suspended its search operation for injured and displaced wild animals from the recent fires that ravaged Somerset West and Table View over the weekend due to bad weather. A fire broke out just after 11am at Rietvlei in Table View on Wednesday last week. Five hours later another fire had broken out at Lourensford in Somerset West, according to reports. Firefighters and various agencies were dispatched to the areas. SPCA inspectors were also at the scene on Sunday looking for injured wild animals. “Although not that many animals have been found as yet, we know they normally crawl out a few days after the fires to try and get food and water. Many of them were badly burnt on their feet and face. We also saw the Lourensford baboon troop. They all appeared to be okay but were evidently in distress,” the SPCA said. They said a porcupine had to be humanely euthanised due to the severity of the injuries sustained. "We concluded our search for animals in Parklands yesterday. We already searched the entire area. In the Lourensford fire in Somerset West, we have suspended the search for now due to the rain; some areas are inaccessible,” they said. City Mayco member for safety and security JP Smith said damage assessments are ongoing. “We commend the efforts of our firefighters who have battled for days, under very trying circumstances, to bring the fires in Somerset West and Tableview under control. The wet weather that has set in has been a massive boost, and brought welcome relief. However, now our Disaster Risk Management Teams and other related City services are on standby to manage any adverse impacts from the series of cold fronts,” he said.  Cape Times
