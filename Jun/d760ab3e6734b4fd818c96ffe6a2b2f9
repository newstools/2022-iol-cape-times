Cape Town - At least 10 schools in the Cape Metro had to be closed while others requested schooling to end early on Tuesday due to torrential rain that caused flooding. A number of children also suffered minor injuries when a school bus carrying more than 50 learners crashed into a ditch on the wet Sonstraal Road in Paarl. Western Cape Education Department (WCED) spokesperson Bronagh Hammond said counselling support would be arranged for 51 learners who were on the bus. "An EMS Rescue vehicle, an ambulance and EMS officials were called in and learners were treated at the scene. No learners were transported to hospital. The learners were then transported to their schools. The WCED is engaging with the relevant authorities and the service provider regarding details of the accident,” said Hammond. According to Drakenstein Farm Watch’s  (DFW) Daan van Leeuwen Boomkamp,  who was among the first to respond at the scene, the bus ploughed into a ditch after swerving to avoid a head-on collision with an oncoming vehicle. He said when they arrived at the scene the pupils had already climbed out of the bus, and after examination by their emergency first aid responders, it appeared that only four had minor injuries and they were treated on site. Reports of schools affected by the inclement weather included those in Philippi, Macassar, Strand, Khayelitsha and Langa. “While some schools were inaccessible early this morning, ongoing rain throughout the day forced other schools to close early. There are reports that there has been increased absenteeism as a result of the heavy rains. Exam or assessment timetables that have been affected will be rescheduled to accommodate any disruption caused at the schools,” Hammond said. Cape Times
