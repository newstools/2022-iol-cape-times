Cape Town - A friend of slain police officer Shameilah Arendse said she will never forget the night her friend was killed in a hail of bullets. Arendse, attached to Table Bay police station, was shot and killed at about 7.40pm on Tuesday night by three unknown suspects while she was sitting on her apartment’s steps with her friends, listening to music. The 26-year-old was a tenant in Gilo Road, Delft. A friend and witness of the incident who asked not to be named for safety reasons said she was afraid the suspects might come after her. “We were just sitting here with two of our friends listening to music and chatting. “About three guys came from the corner and started shooting at her, and at the time they were shooting, she was leaning over me. “I could feel her falling over me and I ran, but they kept on shooting her. “After they shot her the suspects chased the two guys we were with but they could not find them and at the time that they were chasing the two guys I was already in the house but I could hear them swearing,” she said. Police spokesperson Novela Potelwa said no arrests had been made yet. She said the Hawks had taken over the investigation.
