Cape Town - Community Safety and Police Oversight MEC Reagen Allen has said the latest report about yet another alleged mob justice killing, which occurred on the corner of 1st Avenue and Lincoln Road in Belmont Park in Kraaifontein, points to a worrying trend. It is alleged that a 37-year-old man who was accused of a crime was beaten to death by residents. Police spokesperson Colonel Andrè Traut said police were investigating. “Saturday morning at around 11.30am the body of a 37-year-old man was discovered on the corner of Lincoln Road and 1st Avenue in Belmont Park, Kraaifontein. It is suspected that the victim was beaten to death by community members who accused him of a crime. The circumstances are being investigated and arrests are yet to be made,” said Traut. Allen said these incidents were worrying. “This incident highlights a trend that is deeply concerning, especially since the last unjustifiable mob killing of Mr Abongile Mafalala. This and any type of crime can never be condoned. Under no circumstances does any person have the right to take the law into their own hands. Wherever it is suspected that the law was broken, it is our civil duty to contact any law enforcement agency, so that an arrest can occur, allowing SAPS to further investigate the matter and let the court process run its course,” he said. “We understand that there are many communities who are frustrated and might have a deficit of trust in SAPS, but deciding to effect justice by themselves, is just committing another crime. This is unacceptable. The continued increase in the statistics sketches a worrying picture. I will continue to engage SAPS about their efforts to combat these types of crime.” Anyone with information on the incident can anonymously contact Crime Stop at 086 0010 111 or SMS Crime Line at 32211.
