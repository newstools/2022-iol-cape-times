Cape Town - Defence and Military Veterans Minister Thandi Modise says the defence force is on course to alleviate budget pressures and reduce employee-related costs. DA MP Sarel Marais wrote to Modise asking about steps taken to  reduce the employee bill. Marais also asked whether the minister found it was sufficient for the country to have only an air wing instead of an air force, and a water wing instead of a navy to protect the country. In her written response, Modise said the expenditure on compensation of employees comprised R64% of the total budget allocation of R32.7 billion as at February 22. “The department is currently implementing measures and intervention to reduce cost pressures for the 2021 medium term expenditure framework,” she said. These included enlisting new recruits every two years, maintaining the 73 098 soldiers in 2022-23, reducing the man days of the reserve force and deactivating all vacant posts for longer than five years. Modise said the National Treasury had allocated R1 billion for fund severance packages in 2022-23 and a further R800m in the following financial year. “The Department of Defence therefore remains on its trajectory to implement the human resources intervention that will reduce the human resources cost pressures as projected by R993m for the financial year in 2022-23.” The minister  added that the SA Airforce remained a vital service in the SANDF and its performance was well-respected throughout the world. “The current temporary challenges will surely be overcome as we return to fly and dominate the skies.” She also said that the SA Navy was recognised as a worthy competitor in the naval sphere. “This will lead to the navy conquering the seas as we negotiate the recent budget shortfall of the SANDF. Recapitalization processes will be slow and minimal (and) that the South African population must be cognizant of the ever decreasing budget impact it has had on our capabilities.” Cape Times
