Cape Town - An anti-gang Unit member in Gqeberha has been arrested on allegations of murder. The 31-year-old woman was arrested on Tuesday by the Gqeberha-based National Prevention Against Violent Crimes (NPVC) team of the Serious Organised Crime Investigation (SOCI) of the Hawks. Hawks spokesperson Yolisa Mgolodela said it had been alleged that on June 17, 2022, three police members from the Anti-gang Unit were patrolling in KwaDwesi when they noticed three black African males and stopped to search them. All three members searched the suspects and found nothing on them. “The three then returned to their vehicle where three other members were waiting. “It is said that when they alighted the vehicle, the officials heard a gunshot but thought nothing of it. “As they drove away from the scene, the driver noticed that the police member in the back seat was not looking well. “The member at the back then told his colleagues that he was not feeling well and his stomach was sore. “They then realised he was shot and immediately rushed him to Mercantile hospital, where he was declared dead on arrival. “The deceased had one gunshot wound to the left side of his stomach. “The Gqeberha NPVC team of SOCI continued with the investigations that led to the arrest of the suspect, who will be making her first appearance at New Brighton Magistrate’s Court on June 30 2022.” Cape Times
