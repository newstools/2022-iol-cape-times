A series of Generation Z Youth discussions on the growth of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in South Africa have been conducted in Cape Town.  The event was co-ordinated by the University of the Western Cape’s International Relations Office and funded by Longyuan South Africa Renewables (Pty) Ltd. The event drew 68 people to the Auditorium of Life Science Building on the UWC main campus. Respondents came from various cultures, backgrounds, and academic subjects, from those majoring in science to those specialising in the arts and humanities.  In addition to students, health experts such as traditional Chinese and traditional African physicians attended the discussion. All visitors and attendees were welcomed with a Chinese tea-tasting sponsored by the Confucius Institute at UWC, and traditional Chinese delicacies, such as zongzi (traditional Chinese rice dish) to mark the Dragon Boat Festival, were offered to all participants at the event’s conclusion. Dr Ma Xuesheng, senior lecturer in Chinese medicine and acupuncture at UWC, moderated the conversation on the following topics: Chinese medicine legislation and development in South Africa; Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and traditional African medicine (TAM) collaboration; and, Traditional Chinese Medicine development at the UWC community. Dr Yang Hang, a visiting lecturer from Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, did a presentation on the acupuncture technique created by Prof Yu. This technique was explored and demonstrated to the guests at the forum. Longyuan South Africa Renewables (Pty) Ltd hopes to continue holding such dialogues in order to promote and support China-Africa ties, while also educating each other on their own cultures and customs
