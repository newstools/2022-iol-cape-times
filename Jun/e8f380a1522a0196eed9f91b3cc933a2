Cape Town - The Tourism Authority of Thailand has announced that South Africans travelling to Thailand will no longer need a Thailand Pass or health insurance to the value of around R150 000 as of July 1. All travellers still need to be prepared to show at least one of the following proofs upon arrival for random check: These can be in a print or digital format. Random checks will be made on arrivals at Thailand’s international airports or land border checkpoints in 22 provinces. Unvaccinated/not fully vaccinated travellers who are random checked and who are unable to show proof of a pre-arrival negative test will be required to undergo a professional ATK test at the point of entry. Director of Tourism Authority of Thailand London, Sadudee Sangnil said: “We are pleased with this development because it makes travelling to the country easier for both South Africans and foreigners alike. While restrictions have eased, travellers can rest assured knowing that all necessary safety precautions are still in place across the country and that we look forward to welcoming guests back to Thailand again so they can experience the wonders of the country.” Cape Times
