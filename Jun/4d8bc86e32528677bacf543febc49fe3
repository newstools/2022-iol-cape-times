Cape Town - With 37 300 children in foster care in the Western Cape, efforts are being made to clear the foster care backlog before the November 12 deadline. The Western Cape Department of Social Development (DSD) said it has made progress in reducing the backlog of cases, which by the end of May stood at 2 351. Outstanding Foster Care Orders stood at 5 294 in November 2019. The number only refers to the number of foster care court orders that required extension. “The Provincial Foster Care Management Plan is in full effect and we are on track to clear the foster care backlog before the 12 November 2022 deadline,” DSD MEC Sharna Fernandez said. “The Western Cape is faring very well, considering the national backlog of foster care cases stood at 28 246 at the end of March 2022. “However, the department’s work does not stop here. Moreover, we will continuously improve our systems and better co-ordinate with stakeholders, in order to eradicate all remaining foster care case backlogs. “Presently, a total of 37 300 children are in foster care in the Western Cape.” Efforts to close the backlog will include improving co-ordination between social workers, the Children’s Courts and the South African Social Security Agency.
