Cape Town- A kidnapped Kraaifontein man has been freed in a police operation that tracked him to a heavily guarded shack in Browns farm, Philippi. Police spokesperson Frederick Van Wyk said that on Friday at about 6.30pm, members of the Provincial Extortion Task Team and Kraaifontein CID conducted a high risk crime intelligence driven operation after a man was kidnapped in Kraaifontein. “Members received information that the victim was at a (heavily) guarded shack at Browns farm, Philippi. “Members reacted swiftly, and on arrival at the location members had to breach the security gate to gain access to the shack,” Van Wyk said. After further investigation, officers found the man with his hands and feet in constraints. He was positively identified as the abducted victim. Officers also recovered the victim’s grey LDV Isuzu at an informal settlement in Samora Machel and booked it in as an exhibit. “(The) victim was taken to hospital for medical evaluation and care. Investigations continue,” Van Wyk said. This follows news that missing mother, Shireen Essop, was reunited with her family after being spotted in Govan Mbeki Road on Friday at midnight. She was dumped on the side of the road by her alleged kidnappers. She was last seen on May 23, driving down Weltevreden Road in a white Toyota. Her car was recovered in Philippi hours later but there was no sign of Essop. Cape Times
