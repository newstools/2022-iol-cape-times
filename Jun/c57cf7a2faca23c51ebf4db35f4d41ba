Cape Town - G4S Cash Solutions is offering a reward of up to R1 million for credible, useful information leading to the arrest, prosecution and conviction of criminals who shot and killed a G4S security guard during a cash-in-transit (CIT) attack at the Engen Middlevlei filling station on Monday. At around 6pm, the company’s guards were attacked at the filling station on the R28 in Randfontein. One of the perpetrators was caught on camera. Regional cluster director for G4S Southern Africa, Renso Smit, said: “We are devastated at this tragic and senseless loss, and have conveyed our deepest condolences and support to the family of the deceased. We are making it a priority to ensure these criminals are held to account.” In April, G4S wrote to the minister of police and the national police commissioner, to urgently convene a meeting with all stakeholders to address the continuing escalation of violence in CIT attacks. “CIT and cross-pavement attacks are becoming more violent in nature. This is deeply concerning because it puts the lives of our people in danger. “There are not enough prosecutions and convictions to deter these criminals, who are operating with impunity. We are therefore calling on Crime Intelligence, SAPS, the Hawks, the National Prosecuting Authority and the ministers who lead them, to prioritise CIT crime and to re-establish and bolster the National CIT Task Team as a matter of urgency,” said Smit. Anyone with information on the incident can contact Ray Barlow on 083 324 3460, or Shaun Maleo on 083 750 4042 from G4S Cash Solutions. This information can be shared anonymously or on the record.
