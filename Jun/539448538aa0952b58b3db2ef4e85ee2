Cape Town - The City of Cape Town says its teams are on standby to help update prepaid electricity metres in Airport/Crossroads, Bishop Lavis, Delft, Elsies River and Gugulethu. The City said that because the software for all prepaid electricity meters in South Africa will expire in 2024, prepaid metering software must be updated or customers won’t be able to recharge their meters with new tokens; and will be left without power supply. “The City is following a phased approach. Area by area is being earmarked for updating.  “Customers in a specific area will receive two update codes with their purchase when their time comes.  “If the City has not reached an area, and customers have not received the update codes with their electricity purchase, they are not yet due for the update,” the City said. Customers in the Airport/Crossroads, Bishop Lavis, Delft, Elsies River and Gugulethu areas are able to update their electricity meters from July 1 2022 to August 31 2022 and City teams will be on standby in these areas to assist. Eligible customers will notice they are due for the update when they make a purchase and see the update codes. When making a purchase, customers will receive two 20-digit update codes along with their usual prepaid token. Customers may follow these easy steps to enter the update codes when their area is scheduled for the update: 1.    Enter the first 20-digit update code and wait for it to accept. 2.    Enter the second 20-digit update code and wait for it to accept. 3.    Enter the usual 20-digit token to recharge units as normal. Most customers prefer updating their own meters. Those who require assistance are encouraged to contact the City by: ·         SMS: 31220 ·         Email: power@capetown.gov.za ·         Phone: Call Centre: 0860 103 089 The areas earmarked for the next phase of the upgrade from 1 September 2022 to 31 October 2022 are Brackenfell, Kraaifontein, Kuils River, Avalon Estate and Vredekloof.
