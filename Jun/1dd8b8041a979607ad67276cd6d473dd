Cape Town - While provincial firefighting services have had their hands full battling two separate blazes, crew responding to a blaze in Lourensford, Somerset West, had to be treated and transported to hospital after the water tanker they were in rolled down an embankment. City Fire and Rescue Service spokesperson Jermaine Carelse said an emergency call was received at 4.22pm on Wednesday that the mountain slopes were alight at Lourensford. “This is an extensive area of vegetation that is burning. The crews worked tirelessly throughout the night and no property is in danger at this stage. “Standby personnel have been activated to bring more resources to assist,” Carelse said. One of the water tankers rolled down an embankment last night, and the crew had to be treated and transported to hospital. They were discharged on Thursday morning, Carelse said. Carelse noted there were inaccessible areas high up the mountain slopes and that the fire had crept into the Cape Winelands District Municipal area, with most resources allocated to assist there. “Currently we have in excess of 15 firefighting appliances on scene, which includes fire engines, water tankers, bush tenders and skid units with approximately 60 staff on scene. “Aerial support may be activated this morning and crews will remain on scene throughout the day,” Carelse said. Meanwhile, crews are still on scene at a fire that broke out in Tableview on Wednesday. An emergency call was received after 11am that reeds were alight in Gill Road, Tableview. “The smoke was visible as far as the CBD and an aggressive attack was initiated to contain the fire. “An extensive area of reeds burnt. No property was destroyed. No injuries or fatalities were reported,” Carelse said. “We have scaled down considerably and will have only a fire engine, water tanker and skid unit on scene being assisted by Nature Conservation teams,” Carelse added. The cause of the fire is unknown. Cape Times
