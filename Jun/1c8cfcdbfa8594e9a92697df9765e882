Cape Town - A Hanover Park family say they are grateful they were left unharmed after a smash-and-grab incident between Langa and Bonteheuwel on Sunday. Justine, whose last name is being withheld for her safety, said they were driving along Vanguard Drive towards Epping when their car window was smashed. “It was my husband driving and I had my one-week-old baby boy and 2-year-old in front with me, and my 10-year-old and 8-year-old at the back. As we were approaching the robots, my 2-year-old was moaning and crying for her dummy. So I took the baby bag from behind the seat to look for it. The next minute I saw my window on the passenger side had been smashed,” she said. “It seemed the robber was trying to steal my 2-year-old or the baby bag. He also kept hitting my child, as he was pulling on the baby bag. Then he left, but it seemed like there were two of them, because another one appeared and tried to grab the bag also.” She said the robbers made away with the bag, which had a birth certificate, hospital book as well as an ID and a driving licence inside. The panicked family said they then drove to Bonteheuwel police station to report the incident but were shocked by the lack of assistance. “My husband asked if a police van could go with us to look for the items or the guys, and we were told that a van won’t go out to look because ‘the stuff will be long gone’. I’m just so shocked that SaPS wouldn’t go out to help us. Police spokesperson Warrant Officer Joseph Swartbooi said Bishop Lavis police are investigating a case of theft out of a motor vehicle. He did not respond to questions regarding allegations that officers were unhelpful. “An unknown man smashed the window and grabbed visible items and fled the scene and is yet to be arrested,” he said.
