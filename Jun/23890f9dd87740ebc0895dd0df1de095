Cape Town - Opposition parties piled pressure on under-fire President Cyril Ramaphosa to come clean on the theft of US dollars “concealed” on his farm before being allegedly stolen, saying that by invoking the so-called sub-judice rule, he was fuelling the narrative that there was something to hide. “By offering a credible explanation for these events the president would both defend his own integrity, and that of the country.  It feels like the key role-players in the criminal justice system have ceded their power to investigate and prosecute alleged criminals – and to absolve those who are innocent of charges – to opposition politicians, inside and outside the ruling party, and to public opinion,” said Good Party MP Brett Herron. In what resembled a scene from ex-president Jacob Zuma’s reign, Ramaphosa was forced to wait more than an hour before being able to table his budget vote. Labelling him a criminal, money launderer and kidnapper, the EFF led the charge in disrupting Ramaphosa’s budget, saying he needed to address the serious allegation against him.

The charge relates to a 2020 break-in, where in excess of US$4 million (roughly R60m) concealed at Ramaphosa’s Phala Phala farm in Waterberg, Limpopo, was stolen by four Namibian nationals and one South African, Fraser said in a scathing affidavit. While denying any wrongdoing,  Ramaphosa said the matter had been reported to the presidential protection unit. On Thursday, opposition parties used the debate in Parliament to demand answers. Herron said the questions that arose, in the absence of adequate answers – and speedy investigations – had enormous destructive power. “We repeat our call of two days ago for the president to urgently take South Africans into his confidence with respect to the millions of dollars in cash stolen from his farm. By offering a credible explanation for these events the President would both defend his own integrity, and that of the country.” DA leader John Steenhuisen said citizens had a right to know if Ramaphosa was using the VIP protection unit as a private debt collection agency. “just as they have a right to know what happens behind the closed doors of your Phala Phala farm house”.. He noted  that Ramaphosa had avoided the topic during his address, something that would have left ordinary South Africans wondering about what really happened. “If it was above board as you claim, it could have ended right away with a frank and public disclosure. We could have avoided the scenes of today in the House,” he said. ACDP leader Kenneth Meshoe said: “The allegations of corruption, money laundering racketeering and defeating the ends of justice against the president have left many devastated and deeply disappointed.” UDM leader Bantu Holomisa said the onus was on Ramaphosa to consider the suggested course of action for his family, country and himself. “Who will investigate you, Sir? Your police who bungled this investigation? I doubt if they qualify,” Holomisa said. ANC chief whip Pemmy Majodina said: “There are no charges and we are happy the president committed to support the work of the law enforcement agencies." Cape Times
