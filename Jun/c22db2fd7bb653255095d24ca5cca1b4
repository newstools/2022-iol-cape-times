Cape Town – Police have arrested four suspects for the possession of counterfeit money and bank cards in Brackenfell. Police spokesperson Wesley Twigg said efforts to bring criminals to book landed the four suspects, aged between 29 and 43, behind bars on Wednesday morning. “Members of Maitland Flying Squad followed-up information about a suspicious vehicle and pulled it over and searched it. The members found counterfeit money in the vehicle. “One of the suspect’s premises was also searched and ammunition and bank cards were confiscated,” Twigg said. The suspects are due to make their court appearance in the Bellville Magistrate’s court once they have been charged.
