Cape Town - Two pilots were killed after their aircraft crashed in Kinkelbos in the Eastern Cape at the weekend. The men, aged 25 and 33, left Dawid Stuurman airport at about 6.15pm on Sunday, en route to East London. They turned the aircraft around at Kenton-on-Sea and headed back towards Gqeberha before crashing. Eastern Cape police spokesperson Priscilla Naidu said the aircraft was located via aerial view in bushes on a farm in Kinkelbos. “Two pilots died on impact after their light aircraft crashed on a farm in Kinkelbos (Saturday) night. At about 8.07pm, communication with the aircraft was lost and at about 10pm, SAPS Search and Rescue team including the Diving Unit and Gqeberha K9 unit were mobilised to search for the missing aircraft.  The search was abandoned at 2.30am and resumed at 7am. The rescue team was assisted by the SA Air Force and the Mountain Club of SA,” said Naidu. Both pilots were declared dead at the scene. “Police are investigating an inquest. A post-mortem will be conducted to determine the cause of their deaths. The cause of the crash will be investigated by civil aviation authorities,” Naidu said. National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) spokesperson Craig Lambinon said NSRI duty crew were activated to assist the Aeronautical Rescue Coordination Centre (ARCC) in a search operation along the coastline in the vicinity of Colchester between Gqeberha and Kenton-on-Sea. “During the morning on Sunday, an SA Air Force, 15 Squadron Charlie Flight, BK117 helicopter, accompanied by Police and EC EMS, located the aircraft accident site. Sadly both men onboard, located at the aircraft, were declared deceased by paramedics,” said Lambinon. The CAA did not respond to further questions by deadline. Cape Times
