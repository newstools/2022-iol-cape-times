CAPE TOWN - Four suspects have been arrested on charges of drug possession after a cocktail of drugs was sniffed out at a City rental unit in Parkwood on Monday afternoon. City Metro Police spokesperson Ruth Solomons said officers were patrolling in the area when Metro K9 Xena sniffed out the drugs. "Officers were in the area just after 4pm, when they followed up on information of drugs being kept at a Council Rental Unit in the area. Officers sought permission to search the premises, and Xena soon led them to a cupboard in the bedroom with a hidden compartment, where they found a large packet of Tik and a medium packet of cocaine. "K9 Xena then moved on to a motorbike in the backyard, where officers found 29 bankies of Tik and some mandrax tablets. The final stash of 100 mandrax tablets, 40 bankies of Tik and a small amount of unga was found in a Ziploc bag in a washing machine in the backyard," said Solomons. The suspects aged between 18 and 39 were detained at Grassy Park SAPS for possession of drugs. Mayco member for Safety and Security, JP Smith, said: "Our K9s continuously prove their worth in the fight against crime. Our Metro Police K9 unit is already underway to expand itself further in order for us to offer even greater support to our local SAPS members in these areas where drugs and gangsterism are rife. "We call upon national government to help our local SAPS by investing in the highly effective resource of sniffer dogs. If our SAPS members had such a resource readily available in each of the gang hotspot areas, the efficiency in making arrests would be dramatically increased with such enhanced drug detection. Until then, our Metro Police K9 unit will continue to provide as much support as possible to SAPS across all the various areas," said Smith.  Cape Times
