Cape Town - National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) and police divers recovered two bodies adrift at sea, one at Hangklip and another at Simon’s Town, on Tuesday. NSRI Simon’s Town station commander Darren Zimmerman said they received police reports of a body sighted offshore of Long Beach, Simon’s Town . NSRI Simon’s Town shore crew responded, and the police dive unit was dispatched. “The body of an adult male was recovered by police divers and taken on board our sea rescue craft and brought to our NSRI Simon’s Town rescue base. The body has been taken into the care of the government health forensic pathology services. “It appears that the man may have been a worker at local roadworks who had reportedly disappeared from his post in the early hours before being spotted in the surf line later that morning,” Zimmerman said. At about 9.30am, NSRI Kleinmond duty crew responded to reports of a body adrift offshore of Hangklip, between Gordons Bay and Kleinmond. NSRI Kleinmond training officer Michael Markovina said: “Our sea rescue craft was launched, accompanied by police divers, and the body of an adult male was located and recovered. “The body was brought to the Hangklip slipway at Maasbaai.” The NSRI said it had not been confirmed if the body was that of a man who went missing in the area more than a week ago.
