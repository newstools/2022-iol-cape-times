Cape Town - Premier Alan Winde will use Wednesday’s President’s Coordinating Council (PCC) with President Cyril Ramaphosa to make clear the provincial government’s position in favour of the removal of remaining Covid-19 restrictions. Health Minister Dr Joe Phaahla said Cabinet was expected to make a decision soon on the continued mandatory wearing of face masks. “We have been monitoring the epidemic working with the NICD and the current epidemiological analysis, points towards lower infection rates and that the country has exited the recent spike or 5th wave which the current limited regulations were promulgated to mitigate,” he said. Stellenbosch University epidemiologist, Dr Jo Barnes said: “It is high time for a proper review for all the regulations and changes that have been made in the last two years to find out exactly scientifically what had worked and what did not work, as well as what was cost-effective and what wasn’t. So that we can know in future what to do in similar situations. Also so that we can change what we need to change now on a scientific basis.  At the moment the people who make the decisions do not account why they make the decisions, they do not tell the health services or even the advisory committee. All of these matters should be cleared up before they make a coherent response to this.” Cape Times
