Cipla Medpro and the SA Health Products Regulatory Authority (Sahpra), have announced the recall of certain batches of Coryx Throat Spray. “The reason for the Class I Type A product recall is due to the possibility of the spray nozzle detaching from the spray mechanism during use resulting in the spray nozzle being ingested or getting stuck in the throat after detaching,” Cipla said. The product registration number is: W/16.3/58. People who purchased any of these batches of Coryx Throat Spray are requested to return it to their pharmacy, and they will be refunded the purchase price. Cipla SA chief executive Paul Miller, said: “The safety and well-being of our patients is our utmost priority.  “Therefore, after liaising with SAHPRA, it was deemed necessary to recall specific batches of this product from the market. We are working closely with spray mechanism manufacturers to ensure there is no margin for error in future.” Coryx Throat Spray is indicated for the temporary relief of pain and discomfort in sore throats due to colds and accompanying tickling cough. It is also recommended for minor mouth irritations. The product is packed as an amber glass bottle with a screw cap closure. The spray mechanism is co-packed separately in the carton. The product is manufactured by Mirren and Cipla Medpro is the marketing authorisation holder. Cape Times
