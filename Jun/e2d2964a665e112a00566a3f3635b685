Cape Town – The SAPS management in the Eastern Cape has expressed concern over rumours circulating about the cause of death of 21 youngsters at the Enyobeni tavern in East London. Eastern Cape police commissioner Nomthetheleli Mene cautioned against the spreading of fabricated stories which she said carried the potential to sow confusion and doubt into police investigations. “As indicated earlier, at an appropriate time and when an official report has been made available by the experts, the family and members of the public will be informed by the relevant authority. We urge people to refrain from making risky assumptions which do not assist our investigations” Mene said. The tragedy at the tavern occurred early on Sunday, June 26 in Scenery Park, East London. The bodies of the victims have been identified by their families. SAPS said forensic investigators were still examining the evidence. “Until such time that the work of the forensic laboratory is concluded, any informal and unofficial information which is not released by the South African Police Service must be regarded as falsehood and misleading to the public and the affected deceased families.” The SAPS appealed to anyone with information that could assist in the investigation to contact Brigadier Mxolisi Mqotyana at 082 5292 465 or call Crime Stop on 08600 10111.
