Cape Town - A man suspected to be behind the shooting of the 74-year-old father of a former Hawks investigator was arrested on Monday by the Hawks’ National Task Team. Hawks spokesperson, Zinzi Hani said more arrests are imminent. "The 30-year-old suspect is alleged to have been the man behind the killing of Nicholaas Heerschap, the father of former Warrant Officer Nico Heerschap in Melkbosstrand, Cape Town, in 2019. The pensioner was shot at close-range outside the home he shared with his son. "Heerschap was attached to the Hawks’ Serious Commercial Crime Investigation team in Cape Town, and quit his job shortly after his father’s death. It is implicit that the murder was actually aimed at Warrant Officer Heerschap, and not his father, and the motive was due to the investigation he was busy with at the time of his father’s murder," said Hani. Heerschap had been investigating Nafiz Modack. The suspect is due to make his first appearance on Wednesday at the Atlantis Magistrate’s Court on charges ranging from conspiracy to commit murder and Prevention of Organised Crime Act 121 of 1998 related to gang-related offences, said Hani. Earlier this year, gangster Abongile Nqodi, was sentenced to 55 years imprisonment for the murder of Heerschap. Nqodi, affiliated to the Terrible West Siders 28s gang, confessed in his plea and sentencing agreement that on July 9, 2019, together with Riyaat Gesant, Fagmeed Kelly and Mario Petersen, they drove to an address in Melkbosstrand to kill Heerschap.
