Cape Town – Heavy rains accompanied by strong winds have brought some relief to firefighters who for days have been battling a fire in Somerset West, where five homes were damaged. The wildfire broke out at Rietvlei on June 8, and just hours later another fire broke out on the mountain slopes above Lourensford in Somerset West. This affected several areas, including Silverboomkloof, where houses were destroyed, Spanish Farm and the Helderberg Nature Reserve. According to City Mayco member for safety and security JP Smith, on average 24 fire fighting appliances and 90 staff were in Somerset West each day, assisted by various other agencies. “The Lourensford incident command centre (was) closed this morning, while a final assessment will be conducted at Rietvlei today. Damage assessments are ongoing, as part of the final reports into the incidents. The wet weather that has set in has been a massive boost, and brought welcome relief. We commend the efforts of our firefighters, who have battled for days under very trying circumstances to bring the fires under control,” said Smith. Somerset West local councillor Norman McFarlane said the fire in the Helderberg Nature Reserve has been contained, and mopping up operations are coming to an end. City deputy mayor Eddie Andrews visited the nature reserve. He said about 280 hectares had been burnt and damage to infrastructure was being assessed. "Ecologically the fire has not had a negative impact as much of the veld was mature and due for a managed ecological burn. We look forward to the flower displays that will come up during the springtime in the reserve,” said Andrews. Helderberg Nature Reserve has been closed to the public. Cape Times
