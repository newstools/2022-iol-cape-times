Cape Town - UDM leader Bantu Holomisa has written to National Assembly speaker Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula calling for Parliament to investigate allegations that President Cyril Ramaphosa allegedly “covered up” the theft of millions of dollars at his Phala Phala farm in 2020. Former State Security Head Arthur Fraser laid charges against Ramaphosa for allegedly defeating the ends of justice and kidnapping suspects who were allegedly interrogated, citing breaches of, inter alia, the Prevention of Organised Crime Act, no. 121 of 1998 (“POCA”) and the Prevention of Corrupt Activities Act No.12 of 2004 (“The Corruption Act”). The charges are in relation to the theft of in excess of four million US dollars concealed within the premises of the president’s Phala Phala farm in Waterberg, Limpopo, by criminals who were colluding with his domestic worker. While Ramaphosa has admitted that the robbery did, in fact, happen, he denied being involved in any criminal activity. He suggested that Ramaphosa take sabbatical leave until mid-August 2022. “Then, that Parliament and the acting President may institute a preliminary investigation into the entire matter with terms of reference that would include if the South African Revenue Services and the Reserve Bank had any knowledge of the matter. Such a preliminary investigation could be conducted by two or three retired Constitutional Court judges, and their findings could be handed over to the National Prosecuting Authority for further action.” “We have heard some of Mr Fraser and President Ramaphosa's versions of events, as reported in the media. However, both the allegations and the President's answers must be properly tested by a relevant, competent and unbiased body.” Cape Times
