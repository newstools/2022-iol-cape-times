Cape Town - A Dunoon father who set alight his 8-month-old daughter in a communal toilet and attempted to kill his girlfriend is expected in the Western Cape High Court for sentencing on Thursday. Vusumzi Pothelwa was convicted on charges of premeditated murder, attempted murder, assault and arson. He had pleaded guilty to assault and not guilty to the remaining charges. Pothelwa was in a relationship with Sivuyisive Mtshengu and had two minor children with her, including 8-month-old baby Kwezi Mtshengu. They lived in Dunoon, near Milnerton, in a back room of Pothelwa’s sister’s house. According to the State, on November 17, 2019, Pothelwa was drinking alcohol and listening to music in the room while Mtshengu was sleeping in bed with Kwezi. She wanted him to lower the volume but he refused. Pothelwa assaulted his girlfriend when she attempted to lower the volume. Mtshengu then took her baby and went to sleep in a communal toilet. After some time, Pothelwa entered the toilet and swore at Mtshengu. State prosecutor advocate Leon Snyman said Pothelwa spilled paraffin from a heater on both his girlfriend and his baby. “The accused threatened to set her alight and checked his pockets for an ignition source. The accused did not find an ignition source and proceeded to go into the room where he checked the cupboards and drawers,” said Snyman. Mtshengu ran in an attempt to seek assistance so that she could go back for Kwezi but no one helped. She sought refuge at a nearby house she knew was vacant. Around 1am baby Kwezi was found burning in the corner of the toilet after a neighbour was awoken by the smell of smoke. Mtshengu returned in the early morning to find police at the premises and she was informed of her baby’s death. Police later detained and arrested Pothelwa. Cape Times
