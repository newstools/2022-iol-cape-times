CAPE TOWN - Law Enforcement Advancement Plan (LEAP) officers have been lauded for their work in apprehending a suspect who stole a paramedics vehicle in Table View on Saturday. At about 10:30pm while the LEAP Reaction Unit was busy with crime prevention duties in Prince George Drive, Steenberg, radio control sent out an emergency broadcast that a "paramedics vehicle had been stolen in Table View from an accident scene", the City said. While on patrol in Steenberg, officers from the LEAP Reaction Unit identified the vehicle matching its description and driving at a very high speed. “Members then gave chase and caught up with the suspected stolen vehicle and blocked the vehicle off in Muizenberg. “The occupant was then placed under arrest for possession of stolen property, driving while under the influence, reckless and negligent driving and resisting arrest. The suspect was then transported and handed over to Milnerton SAPS for further investigation and prosecution.” The City said the LEAP programme in conjunction with the Provincial Safety Plan continued to deliver results. In terms of national policing, the City called for increased boots on the ground, properly resourced and equipped members and improved training. They also called for improved community structures to ensure the correct information and intelligence streams are available for crime prevention and prosecutions.
