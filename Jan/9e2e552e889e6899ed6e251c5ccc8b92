CAPE TOWN - The Hout Bay dumping site was reopened on Thursday morning after it was closed following a bomb scare. The suspected explosive device which was discovered was in fact a dumped line throwing rocket. The local Community Policing Forum issued a short statement on Wednesday afternoon, calling for an alternative dumpsite to be used after the facility was closed by police for safety reasons. Police spokesperson Wesley Twigg said Hout Bay officers attended to a complaint at the solid waste drop off facility at about 3.35pm. “Members of the K9 Unit attached to the Provincial Extortion Task Team were summoned to the solid waste drop off facility, where they were informed about an explosive device on the premises. “The explosive detection dog Architta was used for an investigative search for the device. The dog reacted positively to the presence of possible live explosives in the device,” said Twigg. A bomb disposal unit technician on the scene disarmed the device and removed it from the site. The area was later declared safe. Twigg said no arrests had been made as yet, while the circumstances were being investigated.  Cape Times
