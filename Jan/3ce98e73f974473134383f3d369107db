CAPE TOWN - Of the 54 people who died in the Western Cape  between November 15 and December 11, 49 were unvaccinated. Premier Alan Winde, in noting that the province passed the peak of the fourth Covid-19 wave, said that 93% of people who died over that period were unvaccinated, which showed that vaccines were highly effective in preventing severe illness and death. Preliminary data collated by the Provincial Department of Health showed that there were fewer deaths among fully vaccinated persons during the fourth wave compared to previous waves. It was found that: "The Provincial Department of Health’s analysis of the fourth wave shows us that there is a widening in the gap between cases, admissions, and deaths if we compare the third wave and fourth wave," Winde said. "This means that while case numbers and test positivity in this wave have exceeded previous waves, hospital admissions are lower than the previous wave at 64% of the third wave admissions peak. Further, while deaths have increased in the last two weeks, they stand at just 24% of the third wave peak. "This is very positive and can be attributed to increased protection from the vaccine, immunity from prior infection, as well as emerging evidence that omicron may be less severe." By Wednesday, the Western Cape vaccine programme had ensured that: To date, 4 483 167 vaccinations have been administered.  Cape Times
