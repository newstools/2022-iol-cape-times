CAPE TOWN - A Belhar mother says she is still in shock after her ten-year-old daughter drowned at Gordon’s Bay beach during a family and friends outing to the coast at the weekend. Leeyonce van Rooien died on Saturday morning while swimming with her 11-year-old brother Leonardo and two friends. “We told them not to go swimming because they had just finished eating, they told us they are going to the park to play,” said Leeyonce’s devastated mother, Nolene van Rooien. Van Rooien said Leonardo returned alone and told the adults “they are in the water, they're busy drowning”. When Van Rooien and neighbour Carmen Davids reached the water they saw the two friends in difficulty but could not spot Leeyonce. “I couldn't see her and the lifeguard kept saying he couldn't find her,” Van Rooien said. ER24 spokesperson Werner Vermaak said shortly after 11am, paramedics from ER24 arrived on the scene where they found Gordon’s Bay Medical as well as lifeguards present. “Lifeguards searched for the little girl. When she was found, she had no signs of life. “Paramedics initiated CPR and rushed her to a nearby hospital. Sadly, she was declared dead shortly after arrival at hospital,” Vermaak said. Van Rooien said the death of her child felt unreal. “It still seems so unreal to me, I don't know what is going to happen in the long run but for now I am okay.” NSRI Gordons Bay station commander Alan Meiklejohn said the City’s water rescue network was activated and Law Enforcement, police, EMS and ER24 ambulance services responded to the incident. On arrival on the scene lifeguards had initiated a search for the girl missing in the surf. “NSRI and emergency services joined in the search and the child was located and recovered from the water about 50 metres across the beach line from where she had been in the water,” Meiklejohn said.
