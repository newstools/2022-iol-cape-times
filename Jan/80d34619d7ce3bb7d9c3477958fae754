CAPE TOWN - With Germany joining the list of countries to drop travel restrictions on Southern Africa, the City says it is ready to welcome visitors eager to escape their harsh winter for a beautiful summer holiday in Cape Town.  The US lifted its travel restrictions on South Africa and several other African countries on Friday. Mayco member for economic growth James Vos welcomed the decision. “I’m very excited by the news that Germany has joined the list of countries to drop travel restrictions on Southern Africa. These restrictions came in the wake of our scientists identifying the Omicron variant. “Research has since shown, however, that piecemeal travel bans are ineffective and only serve to punish the economies of countries that have been banned. “Going forward, global governments must consider alternative measures,” Vos said. “Germany’s revised travel update comes at just the right time, where German travellers are often eager to escape their harsh winter in exchange for a beautiful summer holiday in Cape Town. “I look forward to welcoming these visitors on the Lufthansa flights to Cape Town from Munich and Frankfurt,” he said. The City recently launched its destination marketing campaign in Munich and other major cities to show the diversity of experiences and the beauty of Cape Town. “Germany is a significant travel and trade partner to the Mother City, and we look forward to resuming activity and engaging with them again,” Vos said.
