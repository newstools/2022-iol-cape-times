CAPE TOWN - Firefighters are still monitoring a veldfire on the Matroosberg mountain, sparked by a lightning strike on Friday. The Cape Winelands District Municipality’s fire services on Sunday confirmed they are still attending to the fire in the Matroosberg mountain in De Doorns. “The fire which started in the mountains above De Doorns on Friday night as a result of a lightning strike is being attended to by resources from CWDM, Cape Nature, Volunteer Wildfire Services and various contracted ground teams,” municipality spokesperson Jo-Anne Otto said. The fire has been contained in some areas. “Due to the lack of access to the terrain, fresh teams are being brought in by helicopter this morning. “The teams will focus on fire-fighting operations in the areas where the fire has been contained,” Otto said. The vegetation is made up of mostly indigenous plants interspersed with pines in the kloof. “There is no threat to life and property at this time. No injuries have been reported,” Otto added. Meanwhile, George and Garden Route fire services battled a veld fire throughout Saturday night on the south-western side of Rooirivierrif until it was out, and are monitoring for possible flare-ups. George Municipality said a helicopter from Denneoord Airbase was commissioned to assist with the fire on Saturday afternoon.  Just after 6pm, firefighters had the blaze under control, and air support was withdrawn. Cape Times
