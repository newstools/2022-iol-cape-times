CAPE TOWN - The fire that broke out at Parliament on Sunday morning was still raging by midday, having gutted the third floor of the Old Assembly building, including the office space and the gymnasium. The City’s fire and rescue service said that by noon, the roof of the Old Assembly building had collapsed. “The actual Old Assembly Chamber does not appear to be damaged, although access cannot be gained and it may be water damaged. “The fire has not been contained. “The entire building has extensive smoke and water damage,” the City said. Two water-jet units were among the support brought in, with about 70 fire fighters at the scene. Parliament’s communications office said the cause of the fire had not been established and investigations were under way. It said the fire affected both the Old Assembly and the National Assembly buildings, which house the chambers of the National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces. National Assembly Speaker Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula and Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces Amos Masondo commended the work of the City’s fire and rescue services in containing the fire and limiting the damage as much as possible. “The Department of Public Works and Infrastructure, led by Minister Patricia De Lille, the Deputy Minister of State Security Zizi Kodwa, the South African Police Services and security personnel of Parliament are in the parliamentary precinct assessing the situation,” Parliament said. No person has been injured. “The presiding officers of Parliament are distressed by this incident and the extent of the damage caused thus far to the precincts of the seat of the national legislature. They have urged all relevant authorities to leave no stone unturned in establishing the cause of the fire. The public will be kept updated.” Cape Times
