The judiciary has condemned the attack on the Constitutional Court building, saying the structure was there to facilitate protection of citizens’ constitutional rights. The police on Wednesday arrested a hammer-wielding man for shattering the building’s windows. Acting Chief Justice Raymond Zondo said he noted that the incident happened shortly after the Parliament building was damaged by a fire. “The acting chief justice is satisfied with the report that security officials and the police were able to act swiftly to apprehend the suspect and prevent further damage to the building,” the Office of the Chief Justice said. “Further, the judiciary, appeals to all relevant organs of the state and functionaries responsible for state facilities and security services, to ensure a threat and risk based assessment of arrangements around critical court facilities and its important assets.” The office said it was necessary to mention that the incident did not in any way hamper the justices and court staff from performing their functions. “However, due to such an incident, the security of the judiciary, the supporting staff and the general court users, remains compromised and requires urgent attention. “The acting chief justice is advised that despite the damage to the court facility, no one was injured and the work to have the damage repaired has already commenced. “It is trusted that the investigation by the law enforcement agencies will reveal the motive behind this incident.”  Cape Times
