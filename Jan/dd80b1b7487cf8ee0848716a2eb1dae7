CAPE TOWN - Philippi East police are investigating a murder and an attempted murder after two foreign nationals were shot while delivering bread at a spaza shop in Marikana. A 31-year-old was declared dead on the scene while the other victim was taken to a nearby hospital after being shot in the back during a robbery on Tuesday morning. Police spokesperson FC Van Wyk said the suspects fled in an unknown direction. “According to reports on Tuesday at 11.50am members of Philippi East SAPS received a complaint of a shooting incident in Sheffield Road, Philippi East. "When they arrived at the scene, they found the body of a 31-year-old deceased (foreign national). The deceased was laying on the pavement and had multiple gunshot wounds to his back and head,” said Van Wyk. “The deceased and injured victims were apparently delivering bread at a supermarket when they were attacked by unknown men,” he said. Marikana community activist Xolisa Mphothulo urged delivery vehicles to first consult police before going to their destination, especially in the townships. “The mistake these guys made was to deliver the bread without being escorted by SAPS or a private security guard. "Most bakery vehicles when they deliver bread are being escorted by heavily-armed private security guards who drive behind them to make sure that should anything happen they are ready to defend the bakery vehicle immediately. "You can go to any township, you will never see a bakery vehicle without being escorted and it does not matter the time of the delivery. "I remember, three years back, bakery vehicles were the most targets in our area and that is why they came up with the plan of hiring private companies or they ask the police to escort them. "Most fast foods companies such as KFC or Debonairs do not deliver in the townships and it is because of such crimes,” said Mphothulo.
