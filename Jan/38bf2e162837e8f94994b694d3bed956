CAPE TOWN - Local movie director Phumi Morare, whose short film Lakutshon ILanga (When the Sun Sets) has been shortlisted for a 2022 Oscar, says filmmaking has always been her passion. “I left my job at McKinsey & Co about five years ago to pursue my passion for filmmaking. I have been in the film industry since then,” she said. Lakutshon ILanga tells the true story of a black woman’s transcendence through oppression.

The film has already won a gold medal at the 2021 Student Academy Awards, it also scooped the 2021 Home Box Office (HBO) Short Film Competition at the 2021 American Black Film Festival. Last year it was nominated for a Student British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) award. “It's been beyond my wildest dreams and I’m so amazed that the film has resonated with global audiences to this extent. “For me, this is a film that explores some of my family history, and issues that I’m personally interested in, so to think that others resonate with this, is mind blowing. “I feel truly honoured and so grateful. The film was also my thesis project for my Masters at Chapman University, so it's amazing to see a student film able to reach this type of accolade.” The cinematography was inspired by the photography of Roy DeCarava who used to capture poetic images of black people in Harlem in the 50s and 60s.  The sound designer, Andree Lin, was nominated for an MPSE Golden Reel Award for the sound design on the film. The song that opens and closes the film is also called Lakutshon’ Ilanga and was written by late South African music legend, Miriam Makeba. Cape Times
