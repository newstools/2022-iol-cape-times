Cape Town – Despite a decrease in incidents, the December school holidays provided cover for criminals to target schools, with 41 incidents of burglary and vandalism (affecting 34 schools) being reported, the Western Cape Department of Education (WCED) said. “This is a significant decrease in comparison to the 59 incidents reported during the December 2020/January 2021 holidays (bearing in mind that the 2020/21 holiday was much longer), but nonetheless remains a serious concern,” said Education MEC, Debbie Schäfer. Items stolen included IT and audio-visual equipment, electrical cables and fixtures, fencing, water pipes and ablution fixtures, air-conditioning units, gas tanks, stationery, kitchen equipment, Covid-19 safety supplies, bicycles, and workshop tools. There were also incidents of vandalism, particularly the smashing of windows, as well as damage to school buildings during burglaries, the department added. Schäfer encouraged anyone with information to come forward. “The WCED provided holiday security to 477 schools over the December/January holiday, but in some instances, even security guards and cameras did not thwart determined criminals. “I again urge the public to report any suspicious activity in and around a school to SAPS or the Safe Schools hotline immediately. Please do not underestimate your ability to assist the police to interrupt, investigate and apprehend the perpetrators of these criminal actions by being the eyes and ears on the ground. Even the smallest piece of information can be key. Someone, somewhere knows the perpetrators, and we urge them to do the right thing and report any information that could assist in these criminals being caught and punished,” she said. Crime Stop can be reached on 08600 10111 and the Safe Schools hotline  on 0800 45 46 47. Cape Times
