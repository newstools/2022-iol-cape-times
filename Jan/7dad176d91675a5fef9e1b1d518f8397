CAPE TOWN - A 28-year-old man is expected to appear in the Knysna Magistrates’ Court on Monday for the alleged murder of his mother. Police spokesperson Malcolm Pojie said members of the community handed the man over to police on Friday night in connection with the initial disappearance and subsequent discovery of the body of his 59-year-old mother. Pojie said the woman was reported missing at Knysna SAPS on January 10. She was last seen alive on the evening of January 7. “A search party led by the investigating officer, comprising specialised units, including the K-9 (Dog Unit) and members of the community, ensued, resulting in the discovery of the body of the 59-year-old lady the day thereafter, on Tuesday, January 11,” Pojie said. Her body, already partially decomposed, was discovered by a member of the community in bushes between Alemein and Stroebel Streets in Hornlee, Knysna. An autopsy was conducted to determine the possible cause of death. “Endurance and the constant following up on information about the whereabouts of the wanted suspect resulted in his arrest late the evening of Friday, January 14, by members of the community who handed him over to the investigation team,” Pojie said. The man is scheduled to appear in the Knysna Magistrates’ Court on Monday on a charge of murder. Western Cape police management praised the combined efforts and cooperation between the police and community, which resulted in the suspect being brought before a court of law to be held accountable for the alleged murder of his mother. “Efforts to protect our most vulnerable, such as women and children are often jeopardised as the perpetrators sometimes are those who are the closest to the victims, those who are supposed to shelter, care and protect them, such as in this case,” Pojie said.
