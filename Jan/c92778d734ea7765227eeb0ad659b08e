CAPE TOWN - With the 2022 harvest season on the horizon, South African wine grape producers are expecting a smaller wine grape crop, mainly due to a decrease in vineyards, high disease pressure and heatwaves in certain regions. This is according to the second of four crop estimates by viticulturists and producer cellars in the third week of January. “At this early stage, we expect this year’s wine grape crop to be smaller than in 2021,” said Conrad Schutte, manager of Vinpro’s team of viticulturists who issue the crop estimates together with industry body SAWIS (South African Wine Industry Information and Systems). “The South African wine industry is spread over a wide range of cultivation areas throughout the Western and Northern Cape, with often diverse climatic conditions. Because of this variation, the crop is estimated upwards and others downwards in the respective regions.” The harvest is estimated to be smaller in most wine grape growing regions, except for Stellenbosch, the Cape South Coast and Klein Karoo. Schutte attributed the overall decline in the 2022 wine grape crop to vineyards being uprooted in especially the Northern Cape, Olifants River and Robertson regions, as well as high downy mildew and powdery mildew infections in some of these regions. The ripening period was cooler than normal, but heatwaves in December and January caught some vineyards off guard, causing sunburn damage to grapes. Other than that, wine grape producers experienced an exceptional season, he said. “There is always a great buzz around harvest time, and we are excited to build on the great quality wine grapes and wines that we’ve seen year on year in the vineyards and cellars. We wish all of our producers, winemakers, viticulturists and their teams all the best for a prosperous 2022 harvest,” Schutte said. The next crop estimate by viticulturists and producer cellars will be released in the third week of February 2022. Cape Times
