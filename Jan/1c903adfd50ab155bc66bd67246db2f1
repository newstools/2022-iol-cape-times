CAPE TOWN - This year is set to be an exciting one for six-year-old child golf prodigy, Kian Adonis from Somerset West who has been invited to compete in three international tournaments this year. Kian, a member of SA Kids golf organisation, was a runner up at the Junior Africa challenge in San Lameer, Kwa-Zulu Natal last year. This landed him opportunities to play abroad and he was invited to play his first tournament in Australia in April then his second and third tournament in the US and Northern Ireland in July. “I am excited to play in overseas tournaments and to make new friends,” said Kian, whose favourite golf player is Hideki Matsuyama from Japan. His father, Jerome Adonis said as parents they tried to incorporate different activities apart from golf, including swimming and drama, and to challenge his cognitive thinking abilities. “Kian is very passionate about sports especially golf, he has the talent to go far in golf. He picked up a club when he was 18 months old and could swing and air a ball from 24 months,” said Adonis. Kian has been a member of the Erinvale Golf Estate for three years and his coach JP Viviers said the young boy was very mature on the golf course and already has all the mannerisms of the game. “I haven’t seen another kid of his age with his talent and commitment, if he carries on he will definitely make it big one day,” said Viviers. “For his age he is the only kid that doesn’t want to stop, he comes to the course two three hours before the lesson then carries on another two or three hours after the lesson.” Kian has practice twice a week at De Zalze Golf Course in Stellenbosch. Adonis said for the year Kian is to participate in monthly SA kids tournaments as well as Anna Squirrel tournament which Kian and his brother Reece (5) are both the title holders for 2021. The tournament is played at Devonvale Golf Estate on a monthly basis. Cape Times
