CAPE TOWN –  Nearly 5 000 litres of alcohol was confiscated by law enforcement officers over the festive season.  The City’s enforcement agencies confiscated 8 699 bottles of alcohol, amounting to 4 786.66 litres. The bulk of the confiscations happened on Boxing Day (2 315 bottles). On New Year’s Day, confiscations totalled 1 206 bottles. "I think the weather on New Year’s Day was the biggest contributing factor, as our beaches were not nearly as busy as they might have been otherwise. Or perhaps the penny is finally dropping, and some people are starting to realise that the alcohol is best left at home. One can only hope," said safety and security mayco member JP Smith. "Removing the alcohol through impounding it is no mean feat. Many people become riotous or refuse to cooperate. But I want to remind the public that every litre of alcohol confiscated is potentially one fewer person driving drunk, or swimming drunk, or getting involved in a fight or an accident or hurting someone else,“ he said.
