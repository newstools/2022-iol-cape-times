CAPE TOWN – The SAPS has reiterated its call for people not to share the video of one of its officers who was filmed while in an apparent daze, displaying aggressive behaviour towards his colleagues at the Mitchells Plain taxi rank. This, as experts from the SAPS employee health and wellness unit are working with medical practitioners from a local facility to which the employee was admitted on Thursday. “The police official was captured in videos seemingly acting out of character on Thursday morning in Mitchell’s Plain town centre,” Western Cape SAPS spokesperson Brigadier Novela Potelwa said. “He is currently undergoing observation at a local facility with the necessary support availed to him and his family. “A plea is hereby made to social media users to refrain from speculating  on the underlying causes of the incident that manifested in scenes that were captured in several videos currently in circulation. “While the incident played out in a public space, the circulation of video footage captured on the scene is considered inappropriate. We urge those in possession of the videos to refrain from disseminating the material. “Details and the nature of the SAPS employee’s condition cannot be divulged out of respect for his dignity,” Potelwa said. The Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) previously said they were not investigating the matter as it did not fall under their mandate, while the  Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union (Popcru) said it hoped the officer made a speedy recovery.
