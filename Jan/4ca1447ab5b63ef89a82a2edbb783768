CAPE TOWN – If you see someone who is not wearing a Sea Rescue volunteer uniform with a pink rescue buoy, it has probably been stolen. These are the words of the National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) in Hout Bay after reporting that a pink rescue buoy at Mariners Wharf has gone missing for the second time. The NSRI installed trackers in some of the buoys at the start of the festive season following the continued theft of the lifesaving tool. “We have no information that the buoy was removed to assist in a rescue.  “A temporary replacement body has been installed but we request local residents to please assist us in finding the pink rescue buoy by keeping their eyes open for anyone who is in possession of this easily identifiable bright pink buoy," the NSRI said. The Pink Rescue Buoy Project is part of an extensive National Drowning Prevention Campaign started by the NSRI during 2017. To date the pink buoys have saved 85 lives and won the International Maritime Rescue Federation, in the innovation and technology category in 2018. "A stolen buoy is a stolen life. Our #PinkRescueBuoys are community assets, and we need the assistance of our community to help protect our buoys. A pink rescue buoy should be on its pole or used in a rescue.  “If you see someone with a pink rescue buoy, and they are not a Sea Rescue volunteer who is in uniform, the pink buoy has probably been stolen,” the NSRI said. If anyone has information can contact the NSRI on 0870949774  or  pinkrescuebuoys@searescue.org.za. Cape Times
