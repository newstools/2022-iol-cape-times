CAPE TOWN – A Mitchells Plain hairdresser offering free haircuts to girls in her community ahead of the start of the school year has challenged other hair salons to jump on board, saying the need is greater than what she had imagined. Francine Soldaat, 32,  the founder of Newlook haircare services based in Westgate, Mitchells Plain, is offering the free services to schoolgirls coming from less fortunate backgrounds in her community. The single mom, whose story first appeared in the Daily Voice, said she was inspired by Allistair Pedro, who has also offered free haircuts to primary school boys in his community of Bonteheuwel. “As a single mom of two, I know times can get extremely tough especially with this pandemic, which is why when I saw the gentleman's post, I told myself I need to be part of this. “I am in motion to make this a more permanent service of my business. To me it might just be me getting their hair looking good for school; to them it could mean so much more. It could be the start of something new; a new hope and especially new dreams," she said. Soldaat, who started her hair business from the ground up, said she was now more fortunate to be able to give back. “I started in October 2018, literally from my lounge, bare minimal tools. Clients then had to bend over my bathtub to have their hair washed. Today, I am fortunate to have many more tools and basins and work from my garage. “I am grateful I can do this and so far it's been amazing. But I have to say the need is greater than what I thought and I encourage other hair salons to jump on board.” Cape Times
