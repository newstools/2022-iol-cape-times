CAPE TOWN - Community Safety MEC Albert Fritz has been suspended  pending the outcome of an investigation into what Premier Alan Winde described as serious allegations pertaining to his conduct. In a brief statement on Sunday night Winde said he suspended Fritz after the allegations were brought to his attention in the past week.  Winde could not disclose what those allegations were, only saying: “I have summoned the Minister (MEC) and informed him of these allegations, as well as my decision to suspend him with immediate effect, which he has accepted. I have initiated a full investigation which must proceed on an unhindered basis. Minister (MEC) Fritz has offered his full cooperation in this investigation.” The move comes as Winde was facing pressure not to appoint disgraced former Transport and Public Works MEC Bonginkosi Madikizela as his adviser.  Madikizela had resigned from his post after it was revealed that he had lied about having a degree qualification. He was recently replaced by former mayor Dan Plato who was sworn in as member of the provincial legislature last week. Cape Times
